<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Tammy Hembrow Is Pregnant With Baby No. 3 With Fiance Matt Pole| Insights About Her Net Worth &amp;amp; Da</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>The Instagram influencer model Tammy Hembrow has shared her happy news of being pregnant with her third child on Instagram. She posted a slow-motion video where she announced that she is soon expecting a baby with her fiancé Matt Pole. She wrote, <strong>“Our Hearts are so full.”</strong> The fitness model can be seen in a black long-sleeved dress cut around the midriff walking out to her stunning garden where her fiancé and two daughters are waiting for her.</span></p><p><span>The post followed another three carousel pictures post where the caption was, <strong>“I appreciate all the love more than you know. I still can’t believe I’m going to be a mama of 3! My heart just might explode. I’m growing another little life!!”</strong></span></p><p><span>Many fans noticed the dress she was wearing was the one Kylie Jenner also wore in her announcement too. One fan commented, <strong>“Aw this is the dress Kylie wore in her announcement of being pregnant.”</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Tammy Hembrow Dating Life</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Instagram model Tammy has been open about her relationship with her current fiancé Matt Pole. She had shared a screenshot of a message exchanged between the couples on Instagram which showed Matt asking her how many people would be coming over and joked he wanted oysters and a baby. She wrote along with the post,<strong> “Told you guys he wants one guys.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She also posted a saucy swimsuit picture where they can be seen standing in the shallows of an idyllic beach locking lips. It was captioned, <strong>“Not me scrolling through all my photos of us.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The influencer made her relationship public with her athlete boyfriend, Matt Pole when they were spotted packing on the PDA at Brisbane Airport. Tammy was seen wearing a pink crop top and comfortable grey pants flashing her envy-including abs carrying a balencia white bag. While her beau Matt kept up with a casual hoodie and shortstop off with a baseball cap.</span></p><p><span>The pair celebrated their one-year anniversary 3 months ago by posting a cute video where she captioned the footage, <strong>“One year of you annoying me.”</strong> In the video, Tammy can be seen wrapping her arms around her boyfriend in a skimpy white dress. She later posted an image of lobsters and salmon, two cocktails showing the pair’s romantic dinner to celebrate their one-year anniversary.</span></p><p><span>The model was proposed by her longtime boyfriend, Matt Pole by involving her two children holding signs asking their beloved mother to marry him. He had prepared a private yacht with the bouquets of red roses for the proposal. She shared a post of her diamond ring and captioned it with, <strong>“I’M IN SHOCK honestly have not been able to stop crying happy tears. Yes yes yes my love.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Her fiancé, Matt Pole is a professional surfer and member of the Red Bull surfing team from Australia. He attended the North Curl Primary school and was born in 1988 in Manly, Australia. He is the firstborn child of Ian and Philippa. He has won the U-17 American Iron Man Title and 1 gold medal along with 3 bronze in the World Surf Life Saving Competition.</span></p><p><span>Tammy Hembrow and her ex-fiance Reece Hawkins announced their split in 2018 after sharing two children together in four years of togetherness. She spoke about her breakup with Jute magazine saying,<strong> “ we were young when we got together and still figuring things out. I think when people are weighing in on your personal life while you’re trying to understand things yourself it can feel like a lot of pressure. I share so much of my life, so I understand that my followers online wanted to know what was going on. People were wanting to know what happened before we even knew what was going on.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Tammy herself announced her split in a tearful YouTube video saying, <strong>“One or two months ago, I decided to end things with Reece. He didn’t cheat on me, I didn’t cheat on him. It wasn’t like that at all.”</strong></span></p><p><span>However, Tammy Hembrow has seemingly thrown shade at her ex-fiance when her fiancé, Matt Pole stepped up for their children on Father’s Day. She posted a snap of Matt along with her two children and wrote,<strong> “You will not be their father by blood however the bond you might have with my infants is one thing else. Thank you for stepping up and being such a tremendous function mannequin and help of their life. We love you.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The model shares two children with her ex-fiance, Reece Hawkins. They are one daughter, Sakia, 5 years old, and one son, Wolf, 4 years old. She is now expecting a baby with her present fiancé Matt Pole.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Tammy Hembrow</span></strong></h2><p><span>Tammy Hembrow is not only an Instagram influencer, she is a businesswoman who has grown her net worth to around $2 million. She has launched an activewear brand called the Saski collection. She is also linked to having a deal with sports nutrition brand, Women’s Best for which she is estimated to have been <a href=# rel=noopener>paid up</a> to $45,000 a month. She is a proud mother, entrepreneur, Gymshark athlete, and fitness mentor.</span></p><p><span>She has become so popular on Instagram that she has made another private account on the site where she shares full workouts and eating habits with her fans who buy access to that account as she intends to motivate and inspire women to live happier, healthier lives.
