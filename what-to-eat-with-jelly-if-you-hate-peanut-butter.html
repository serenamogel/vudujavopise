I KNOW. I wasn’t aware of this fact until I lived in Australia briefly as a kid and all the kids there thought peanut butter was as disgusting as I thought Vegemite was. But the PB hate isn’t just limited to down under, I know there are plenty of people out there who could take or leave the flavorful, nutty, lunchbox staple. And then there are the people who are allergic to peanut butter! Those people still deserve to eat jelly on things. And because we want everyone to be able to eat the jelly they deserve, here is a list of what to eat with jelly if you hate peanut butter.</p><p>If you are looking for what to eat with jelly if you hate peanut butter, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">almond butter</a> is going to be your closest 1:1 bet. I know what you’re thinking, “But Jessica, almond butter tastes like creamy nothingness!” Well, my friend, while that is typically the case, I can assure you that this almond butter hits different. It is sweet, salty, and roasty-toasty almondy as heck. Plus, unlike other almond butters, “there’s not an upsetting amount of oil when you open the jar.” And if that isn’t a win, I don’t know what is. Try this one out with some raspberry jam and thank me later.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Almond Butter: Move Over PB, These Almond Butters Are Incredible</a></strong></p><strong>Pistachio Butter</strong><p>When Rhett & Link tried pistachio butter in their big <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative nut butter taste test</a>, this one made the top three. While it may have a bit of a gluey texture (depending on the brand), if you like the flavor of pistachios, you will like this option very much. Slap it on a sandwich with some blackberry preserves!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A Better Butter? Rhett & Link Blind Taste Test Nut Butters</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lotus Cookie Butter</strong></a><p>Put jelly and cookie butter together on a sandwich and you essentially have one of those little thumbprint cookies in the form of a sandwich. Me, personally? I’m a big proponent of sandwiches that taste like cookies. Really just a fan of dessert sandwiches in general. That being said, when picking a cookie butter, you can’t go wrong with Lotus, the OG cookie butter that tastes like mashed-up Lotus biscuits, oil, and sugar, because that’s EXACTLY what she is and we love her for it. Have it with some cherry jam or, better yet, cinnamon apple jam or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">orange marmalade</a>.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Can’t Control Myself Around Cookie Butter</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pillsbury Creamy Supreme Chocolate Fudge Frosting</strong></a><p>I’ll be honest. I thought about putting Nutella on this list. But then I thought, “What if I skipped the middle man and just put what we all wish Nutella was on this list? So, here it is, Nutella’s more dessert-like and chocolatey cousin: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chocolate frosting</a>. But not just any chocolate frosting, it’s the best frosting we tasted during our frosting taste test. According to senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a>, this stuff is “chocolatey, sweet, and rich. The texture is silky smooth. There’s no artificial aftertaste.” It just tastes like good ol’ fashioned chocolate cake frosting. Now imagine this with literally any jam between two slices of potato bread or wonder bread. Ugh, divine. Add some rainbow sprinkles, present this to me on one knee, and I will marry you.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Cake Frosting: The Best Frosting at the Grocery Store Might Surprise You</a></strong></p><p>Hey, I get it, just because you don’t like peanut butter doesn’t mean you aren’t a bougie b*tch, so here is a bougie b*tch way to enjoy your peanut butterless jelly (and make all your friends ~jelly~ in the process). Extra sharp fancy cheddar and jam on salty crackers or a crusty baguette. It is SUCH a good combo. Slap some roasted garlic on there, present this to me on one knee, and I will also marry you. What can I say? I like good food a lot and have very low standards in most other departments. Y’all seriously need to try this cheddar, though. It is nutty, salty, and has those little flavor crystals good parmesan has. Don’t believe me? Jordan called it “sharp cheddar for when you’re hosting company you actually like.”</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It Doesn’t Get Better Than the 7 Best Cheddars</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Appleton Dry Cured Ham Prosciutto</strong></a><p>Much like the salty cheese above, porky <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prosciutto</a> also makes a good jam pairing. In other words, have a prosciutto and jelly sandwich and unlock a whole <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new symphony of Ratatouille-style</a> combos in your brain. Heck, throw some of the Old Croc cheddar, this prosciutto, and some berry jam on a sandwich and you’ve got yourself a charcuterie dream wrapped in an enigma wrapped in bread. Editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> described the flavor of this very affordable prosciutto from Aldi as “out of this world—it’s savory and sweet (almost fruity) with a wonderfully fatty finish that just keeps going.” So, head over to Aldi and treat yourself this week.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Prosciutto to Buy That Is Actually Affordable</a></strong></p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mnJqsXay2tbSMo5ylpKlitqd52KisZqCRqbJuvMSapa6sXZfCtcDEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pretty-nicole-leaked-video-trending-on-domain-6-domain-10-tiktok-watch-video.html><span>←</span><span>Pretty Nicole Leaked Video Trending On Twitter, Reddit &amp;amp; Tiktok (Watch Video) The Talks Today</span></a>
