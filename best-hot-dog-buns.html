They bring a mildly sweet flavor, a hint of yeastiness, and a satisfying chew.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2024 grilling season is here, and we’re leaving the days of bun breakage and crumbly bread in the past. In fact, we take the title of “Grill Dad” very seriously at Sporked. And let me be clear: Anyone can be a Grill Dad. Your mom can be a Grill Dad. Hand your eight year old some lighter fluid and a spatula—that’s a Grill Dad now. The only people who can’t claim the title of “Grill Dad” are those who spend all their energy concentrating on the quality of the <a href=#>hot dog</a>s and ignore the importance of choosing the best hot dog buns. That’s not big Grill Dad energy. That’s big Grill Sad energy. You’re sad. And we don’t like you.&nbsp;</p><p>Kidding! I’m kidding. We do like you, and we completely get the struggle. It’s easy for the artist to disregard the canvas. That’s why we’re here, sitting down for our second taste test of the best hot dog buns. No matter what type of buns you’re looking for—and I assure you, they come in many different shapes, sizes, and yes, tastes—we’ve got you covered. From the best brioche hot dog buns to the best gluten free hot dog buns (yep, we found some decent ones), here’s what the real Grill Dads are buying.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#d29079></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Gluten Free Hot Dog Buns" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_HOT-DOG-BUNS_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Gluten Free</p><strong><strong>Schar Gluten Free Hot Dog Rolls</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Our gluten free friends already know the deal: Finding even one brand of gluten free buns is hard, nevermind the best GF hot dog buns. But we wouldn’t shine a spotlight on Schar Hot Dog Rolls if they didn’t seriously impress us. These buns have a subtle sourdough flavor and good doughy structure, breaking apart nice and evenly—without crumbling into bits. That’s not easy to do with <a href=#>gluten free bread</a>, folks. (That said, the bag of buns we bought were oddly shaped and fatter on one end than the other. Not sure what’s going on there, Schar.) These are the best gluten free hot dog buns out there right now, but if you can eat gluten, I would skip them in favor of the others that made the list. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#d38e83></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="Best Keto Friendly Hot Dog Buns" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RANKING-UPDATE_HOT-DOG-BUNS_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Keto Friendly</p><strong><strong>Kroger Carbmaster Classic White Hot Dog Buns</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralphs</a><p>For those of you not on the keto diet, let me tell you a secret about <a href=#>keto-friendly bread</a>: There is typically some sort of funky aftertaste. Sometimes it’s too sweet, sometimes too sour. I tried a few different brands and was getting more and more dejected… until Kroger Carbmaster stepped up to the plate. These almost pull off the yeasty taste and soft texture of normal bread buns, easily earning the title of best keto hot dog buns. They have a slightly sour aftertaste, but compared to other keto-friendly hot dog buns, it’s super mild.

I can’t say the flavors are particularly bold, but that’s what makes these Hawaiian hot dog buns versatile and crowd-pleasing.

They have the mild sweetness that you crave from brioche while still allowing the flavor of your favorite hot dog to shine through.
