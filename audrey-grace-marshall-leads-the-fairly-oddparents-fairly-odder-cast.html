Paramount Pictures released the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official trailer</a>, which features a grown-up Timmy Turner (Caleb Pierce) and his cousin Vivian (Audrey Grace Marshall), who inherits the gift-granting fairies Cosmo (Daran Norris) and Wanda (Susanne Blakeslee).</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>As previously mentioned, the live-action series will revolve around Timmy’s 13-year-old cousin Viv and her stepbrother Roy (Tyler Wladis) after they inherit Cosmo and Wanda. Fairly Odder will be picking up years after&nbsp;the original series&nbsp;ended in 2017, following a fresh set of youths as they navigate life in Dimmsdale with the magical help of their fairy godparents.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Who is in the Fairly Oddparents: Fairly Odder cast?</h3><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=978 data-injectable=true>After Paramount kindly unveiled the official trailer for Fairly Oddparents: Fairly Odder, audiences got some first impressions of the cast in character. It goes without saying that years after the original series ended, viewers were devastated to see a childhood classic reach its finale, and a live-action series has some big shoes to fill. Some familiar faces (or rather, voices) popped up during the trailer, much to the delight of those who grew up watching Fairly Oddparents in its prime (present company included). Here are the confirmed cast members for Fairly Oddparents: Fairly Odder.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>In Fairly Odder, the college-aged&nbsp;Timmy Turner is played by Caleb Pierce, who has previously appeared on&nbsp;Insecure, The Big Bang Theory and Grey’s Anatomy. Pierce will be taking on the mantle from a famous Nickelodeon star and child entertainer. In the 2011 live-action film A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!, Drake Bell (Drake & Josh) portrayed Timmy Turner.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=825 data-injectable=true>13-year-old rising star Audrey Grace Marshall portrays Vivian Turner, Timmy Turner’s younger cousin.

Although not much is known about Zina’s role within the universe, process of elimination points to Zina being a potential best friend to Marshall’s Turner. Cohen appeared in the 2020 short Dear Mom and will appear in an upcoming Christmas film The Naughty Nine about children on the naughty list that assemble to get the presents they think they deserve.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>Adult actress Laura Bell Bundy, who has performed in a number of&nbsp;Broadway&nbsp;roles, including the original Amber Von Tussle in the musical version of&nbsp;Hairspray, the original&nbsp;Elle Woods&nbsp;in the musical version of&nbsp;Legally Blonde, and Dr. Jordan Denby on television’s&nbsp;Anger Management. In 2010, she released two singles, “Giddy On Up” and “Drop on By”. In Fairly Odder, Bundy will portray Roy’s mother, Rachel Ragland.</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Ryan-James Hatanaka joins the cast as Ty Turner, presumably a Turner relative. For television, Hatanaka portrayed Gabriel Kinslow in When Hope Calls and Detective Abe Tamura in Nancy Drew. His theater credits include Shakespeare in the Park’s production of King Lear alongside John Lithgow and Annette Bening, Big Love and The Sandbox.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>Another up-and-coming actor, Tyler Wladis portrays Vivian’s stepbrother Roy Ragland.

Previously, Ragland played Ralphie’s little brother Randy Parker in Fox’s&nbsp;A Christmas Story Live!&nbsp;and appeared in regional productions of Ragtime and Beauty & the Beast.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Additionally, the Fairly Odder movie features familiar voices from Daran Norris and Susanne Blakeslee, who will reprise their roles as Cosmo and Wanda, respectively. In the Fairly Oddparents series, Norris also provides the voices Jorgen Von Strangle,&nbsp;Anti-Cosmo, and&nbsp;Mr. Turner.
