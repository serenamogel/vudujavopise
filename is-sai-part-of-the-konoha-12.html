Sai Yamanaka (山中サイ, Yamanaka Sai) is a Chūbu of Konohagakure's Yamanaka clan. Prior to this, he was an Anbu from Root.<h2>Does Sai possess rinnegan?</h2>Sai never had rinnegan. But If you are talking about when infinite tsukuyomi was been used, at that time not only Sai but about everyone obtained a rinnegan, and were been caught in an infinite genjutsu.<h2>KONOHA 12 POWER LEVELS - AnimeScale</h2><p></p><h2>What is Sai's real mission?</h2>In doing so he discovered Sai's actual mission: to kill Sasuke as a traitor to Konoha.<h2>Is Sai related to Ino?</h2>It is revealed in the final chapter that Sai and Ino are married and have a son named Inojin Yamanaka.

Deidara's abilities were like a far more effective version of Sai's ink drawings. He had the ability to create huge golems that could fly or swim, which could also explode.</p><h2>Is Sai an Uchiha?</h2>no. Sai was an orphan. He had no other attachments to anything or anyone other than Root and Danzo. If he were an Uchiha, surely by now his dojutsu would have been made a prevalent part of the series (along with an attempt by Danzo to steal the eyes).<h2>Is Sai a villain in Naruto?</h2>Is Sai evil in Naruto? No. Early Sai didn't even have the capability to be evil OR good, as he didn't really understand the difference. Early Sai saw himself as merely an emotionless weapon in the hands of the village (in his case, personified by Danzo).<h2>Is Sai in the Konoha 11?</h2>Sai, through serving as the replacement of Uchiha Sasuke on Team Kakashi, is a technical stand-in member of the collective group. Despite not being introduced until Part II, Sai shares unique relationships with individual members of the Konoha 11, their jonin mentors, and Sasuke himself.<h2>Are all Konoha 11 jonin?</h2>This is my first post here and I was re-watching the last two Naruto movies and realized that even though it was not confirmed or even true, but most of the Konoha 11 should be in Jonin rank simply based on their representation in the movie.<h2>Is Sasuke in Konoha 12?</h2>Since Sasuke returned back to konoha, he is included in the list. The Konoha 12 Ranking After the war. This ranking is not only based on physical strength or attacking skills.<h2>Who is Himawari crush?</h2>The Couple. InoHima (じんヒマ JinHima) is the term used to refer to the romantic relationship between Inojin Yamanaka and Himawari Uzumaki.<h2>What clan is jiraiya from?</h2>In the 20th-century, the story was adapted in several films, in video games, and in a manga. Jiraiya is a ninja who uses shapeshifting magic to morph into a gigantic toad. Heir of the Ogata clan, Jiraiya fell in love with Tsunade, a beautiful young maiden who has mastered slug magic.<h2>Who is Sasori's spy?</h2>Yamato, disguised as Sasori, went to meet the spy. The spy was revealed to be Kabuto Yakushi, but the technique binding him to Sasori had been dispelled long ago.<h2>Does Sakura become Anbu?</h2>Is Sakura Haruno exceptional enough to be appointed into ANBU Ops? Yes. But for all her strengths and abilities, canon! Sakura couldn't make it to ANBU Black Ops NOT BECAUSE she is not worthy of becoming an ANBU member, BUT BECAUSE that goes against everything Sakura believes in.<h2>Why is Sai so weird?</h2>Because of Sai's training with Root, he has spent most of his life not really in touch with his own emotions. He's been trained to push them down and ignore them. Even as he learns to get back in touch with them, he still retains some of his training and some of the personality traits that came out of this.<h2>How old is Sai in Boruto?</h2>Sai was Sasuke's replacement for Team 7 when Naruto returned, and he was partnered with Naruto and Sakura. Although they got off to a rough start, he became good friends with them. He developed feelings for Ino and married her in Boruto. Throughout Shippuden, Sai is 17.<h2>Is Sai related to Orochimaru?</h2>Sai is Orochimaru's Son!!!<p>First off, let's look at their obvious physical similarities. Orochimaru: Sai: Notice how they have the same skin color that no other Naruto...</p><h2>Is Naruto Sai powerful?</h2>Sai was a former member of Danzo Shimura's Foundation and Sasuke's replacement for Team Seven in the Naruto universe. Despite his awkward mannerisms and clumsy social skills, he was a powerful shinobi on account of his ink-based jutsu and formidable melee prowess.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKyZmWK9or7TZqafZaSdsm63zqemoZldZn8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-more-you-take-the-more-you-leave-behind-what-am-i-riddle-answered-html.html><span>←</span><span>The More You Take the More You Leave Behind, What am I?
