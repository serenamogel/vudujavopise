It’s sweet, it’s tart, and it’s packed with vitamin C, but for some reason it’s never achieved refrigerator-staple status like <a href=#>orange juice</a> or <a href=#>apple juice</a>. Anyway, if you haven’t had it in a while or only think of it as a mixer that comes in a little pull-tab can behind a bar, I’m excited to remind you that the best pineapple juice is worthy of a spot in your fridge, whether you’re looking for the best pineapple juice for cocktails or a tasty blend, like pineapple orange juice. Either way, there’s way more out there than the Dole pineapple juice you grew up with.</p><p>Over the course of two separate taste tests, we tried more than a dozen brands to find the fruitiest, juiciest, best tasting pineapple juice you can buy. We promise, they’re good with or without rum.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pineapple juice dole" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RANKING-UPDATE_PINEAPPLE-JUICE_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Punch</p><strong>&nbsp;Dole 100% Pineapple Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Dole pineapple juice in a big ol’ can is the preeminent pineapple juice brand, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best brand of pineapple juice. I will say that there’s something pleasantly nostalgic about its flavor (can and all). It isn’t from concentrate, is super smooth, and it’s really cheap, too. Next time you’re having a party, combine a few cans of this with some <a href=#>cranberry juice</a> and a little <a href=#>lemon lime soda</a> and, voila, you have a simple, delicious punch. Spike it if it’s that kind of party.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pineapple juice" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RANKING-UPDATE_PINEAPPLE-JUICE_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Signature Select 100% Pineapple Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>In terms of flavorful, shelf-stable, and cheap pineapple juice, it was a fight to the finish between Signature Select and Dole pineapple juice. This store brand juice that’s carried at&nbsp; Albertsons-owned grocery stores edged out its competition just slightly by virtue of not having that slight tinny flavor that can accompany a canned juice. If you’re looking for something cheap and reliable, you’ll like this.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pineapple juice blend" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RANKING-UPDATE_PINEAPPLE-JUICE_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Blend</p><strong>Dole Pineapple Orange Banana</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>If you like pineapple juice but don’t necessarily need it to be the star, this banana-pineapple-orange juice from Dole is the best pineapple juice for you to buy. It’s essentially a pineapple-forward fruit punch, minus the cherry juice most <a href=#>fruit punch</a> has at the forefront of its flavor profile. It’s really tasty! In fact, I think it’s better than Dole pineapple juice on its own. The apple and other juices in the mix lighten it up and improve the flavor of their pineapple concentrate. If you’re into fruit juice blends but want something that leans pineapple-y, this is the best tasting pineapple juice.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target&nbsp;</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pineapple juice to mix with alcohol" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RANKING-UPDATE_PINEAPPLE-JUICE_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Mixer</p><strong>RW Knudsen Family Just Pineapple Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>You might not expect a really good pineapple juice from a company with a Swedish name, but the Knudsen pulled it off with this little bottle of shelf-stable juice, which struck us as the best pineapple juice for cocktails. It doesn’t have the tartness or bite of some of the refrigerated varieties we tried, but there’s absolutely a place for this sweet stuff. Namely, in your pantry until that rainy day rolls around when you desperately need a rum (or vodka or gin) and pineapple juice cocktail to brighten things up. This one runs a little thick and can really hold up to a shot of liquor.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pineapple juice" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RANKING-UPDATE_PINEAPPLE-JUICE_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Runner-Up</p><strong>Trader Joe’s Pineapple Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Trader Joe’s</a><p>The last time we ranked pineapple juice, we were super impressed with Trader Joe’s little individual bottle of cold-pressed pineapple juice, but we replaced it with this carton of juice, which is more practical, better for sharing (if you’re willing), and still among the best tasting pineapple juice you can buy. I tasted this alongside Dole refrigerated pineapple juice in a carton and it was immediately apparent which one was from concentrate (Dole). This Trader Joe’s pineapple juice tastes exactly like a freshly juiced pineapple. It’s not acidic or astringent like some pineapple juice. It’s so smooth and has an excellent viscosity. We buy a lot of fresh pineapples at my house and this tastes exactly like a fresh pineapple. In my eyes, this is tied for the number one spot with Nature’s Nectar. If you shop at TJ’s or Aldi, buy pineapple juice!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pineapple juice aldi" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RANKING-UPDATE_PINEAPPLE-JUICE_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>Nature’s Nectar Pineapple Juice</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>This pineapple juice from Aldi—the best pineapple juice we tried in two separate taste tests—is simultaneously smooth and tart, and we all really, really loved it. It’s smooth, but has an almost citrusy bite that was missing from most of the other juices we tried. “I feel like some kind of bougie lady on a beach,” one taster said when they took a sip. Truly, it’s like a tropical vacation in a carton (which, granted, doesn’t sound like much of a vacation). It’s sweet, perfectly balanced, and incredibly delicious. It’s the best tasting pineapple juice and it’s cheap since it’s from Aldi!&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Lakewood Pure Pineapple, Tropicana Pineapple Mango, Great Value Pineapple Juice, Sprouts Pineapple Juice, Langers Pineapple Juice, Kroger Pineapple Juice, Libby’s Pineapple Juice, Good & Gather Pineapple Mango, Ocean Spray Cran Pineapple, Ocean Spray Diet Cran Pineapple, Minute Made Pineapple Horchata, Dole Pineapple Orange</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvMinnJqooKGybrbUopqeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pretend-youre-xyzzy-mafia-endgame-midorikawa-has-received-6-awesome-points-congrats-16-5-2017-223043.html><span>←</span><span>Pretend You're Xyzzy Mafia - Endgame: Midorikawa has received 6 Awesome Points!
