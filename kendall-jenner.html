She got her first taste of success and stardom on the family’s popular reality television show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians. From there, Jenner launched a modeling career. Soon after appearing in an ad campaign for Forever 21, Jenner was propelled to high fashion runways for major international designers and magazine spreads. In a short time, she has earned a spot as one of the most in-demand and highest-paid models in the fashion industry. Like her siblings, Jenner is also a powerhouse on social media and is recognized as a top fashion e-commerce influencer. She has also branched out into merchandising her own brands of clothing, accessories and make-up.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Family and Early Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kendall Nicole Jenner was born on November 3, 1995, in Los Angeles, California to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/kris-jenner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kris class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kris</a> and Olympic champion Bruce Jenner.

In 2013, Jenner shared the Teen Choice Award for Favorite Female Reality Star with her sisters.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Modeling and Fashion Ventures</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When she was 14, her mother signed Jenner to Wilhelmina Models modeling agency and she began her career doing fashion shoots for the popular clothing chain Forever 21. More work came her way after landing a photo in Teen Vogue and a plethora of other ad campaigns for notable brands primarily in Australia. Since then, Jenner has appeared in high fashion runway shows and campaigns wearing the likes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/marc-jacobs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marc Jacobs" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marc Jacobs</a>, Chanel, Givenchy, Dolce & Gabbana, among others. By the end of 2014, the young model was dubbed the new “It” girl.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jenner’s hot streak has continued, working more elite runway shows for fashion’s top brands and scoring photo spreads in magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar, GQ and Vogue. She also took home Teen Choice awards for Favorite Model in 2015 and 2016 and made it to Forbes’ list of highest-paid models, later topping the list in both 2017 and 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of modeling, Jenner has extended her brand name to nail polish lines, jewelry and, along with her sister Kylie, a line of clothing in the popular retailer Topshop, as well as shoes and handbags at Steve Madden’s Madden Girl. In 2016, as the new face of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/estee-lauder data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Estée Lauder" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Estée Lauder</a>, she also announced a make-up line.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jenner has dabbled in acting, appearing on Hawaii Five-O in 2012 and in Ocean's 8 in 2018, as well as in music videos. She has also become a regular at award shows like the 2016 MTV Movie Awards and is a social media powerhouse, joining her sisters as one of the most-followed people on Instagram.</p><img alt="Kendall Jenner Photo" title="Kendall Jenner Photo" width=2268 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/GettyImages-477504950.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Fragrance Foundation</span><p>Kendall Jenner</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Pepsi Ad and T-Shirt Line Controversies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Always teetering on the edge of controversy with her Kardashian-reality television roots, Jenner was singled out and publicly ridiculed in April 2017 for her starring role in a Pepsi ad campaign called "Live For Now," in which she used the beverage to heal the divide between police and protesters. The ad was lambasted for trivializing the Black Lives Matters movement and was consequently taken off the air just one day after its debut. Jenner was reportedly "devastated" by the backlash, but due to her contractual agreement with Pepsi, was unable to comment publicly on the matter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Just two months later, Jenner faced even more controversy, along with younger sister Kylie, for promoting vintage T-shirts through their clothing line Kendall + Kylie. The shirts contained the images of musicians like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/tupac-shakur data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tupac Shakur" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tupac Shakur</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/biggie-smalls data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Notorious B.I.G." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Notorious B.I.G.</a> with the sisters' faces superimposed on them. Not only did they face public backlash, but they were also met with legal troubles, as they had violated copyright laws by not seeking permission to use the images. As a result, the sisters removed the shirts from their site and issued an apology.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Relationships</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unlike her sisters, Jenner remains largely quiet about her love life, though she has been linked to rapper <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/asap-rocky data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A$AP Rocky" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">A$AP Rocky</a> and basketball stars Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons and Devin Booker.</p><ul data-node-id=23 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1995</li><li>Birth date: November 3, 1995</li><li>Birth State: California</li><li>Birth City: Los Angeles</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Kendall Jenner is a fashion model, Instagram star and one of the famous siblings featured on the hit reality show 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians.'</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
