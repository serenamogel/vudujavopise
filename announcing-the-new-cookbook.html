The main thing that I want you to know about it is that, well… it’s packed with all of my absolute favorite recipes, ones I’ve been obsessively making, eating, serving, and testing nearly every day for the past three years. It’s a big fat beautiful book packed with all-new vibrant veggie recipes (none are on the blog – you’ll only find them in the book) and lots of beautiful visuals to inspire you to make fun, delicious food. It’s coming out April 2nd, and you can pre-order it now!</p><p>My approach to this cookbook was very different from the first book. With the first book, I focused all of the recipes on my farmers market finds, and I based dishes solely off that inspiration. With our recent move closer to my family in Chicago, I decided to change things up a bit. With Chicago’s farmers market season being much shorter, as well as having more meals with my extended family, I shifted the focus of this book more towards everyday cooking with vegetables that you can easily find – whether you’re shopping at the grocery store or the farmers market. Of course, the book is full of recipes featuring gorgeous produce, but it’s organized by meal type, so you’ll easily find something yummy to make any day.&nbsp;This means more meals that your whole family will love with vegetables at the center of the plate.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>PRE-ORDER TODAY!</strong></p><p style=text-align:center>U.S.<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barnes & Noble</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Indiebound</a></p><p style=text-align:center>Canada:<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chapters Indigo&nbsp;</a> /&nbsp; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon.ca</a></p><p style=text-align:center>International:<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Book Depository</a></p><p style=text-align:center>eBook:<br><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Apple Books</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Google Play</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kindle<br></a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kobo (US)</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kobo (Canada)</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp; <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nook</a></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/announcing-the-new-cookbook/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/r6-3-2.jpg&description=The+new+Love+%26+Lemons+cookbook%2C+Love+%26+Lemons+Every+Day%2C+is+available+for+preorder%21+It%27s+packed+with+100%2B+all-new+vibrant+veggie+recipes%2C+all+the+way+from+breakfast+to+dessert.+It%27s+a+big+fat+beautiful+book%2C+and+a+fun%2C+essential+kitchen+resource.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23cookbook+%23vegetarian+%23vegan+%23recipes+")'></span></span></p><p>So, what’s in the book?</p><p><span class=s1><b>100+ all-new vibrant recipes that make vegetables insanely delicious!</b></span><span class=s2><b><br></b></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Love & Lemons Every Day is the perfect book for making any meal, from breakfast to dessert, where vegetables (and/or fruits) are the star. Butternut squash becomes the best queso you’ve ever eaten, broccoli transforms into a<i> </i>zesty green “rice” burrito filling, and sweet potato blends into a smooth chocolate frosting. The book is organized by meal type, including Breakfast, Snacks & Starters, Salads, Soups, Side Dishes, Desserts, Drinks, and Homemade Extras, but the biggest chapter by far is Dinner! Because, when I personally read cookbooks, I’m usually looking for something inspiring to make for dinner, and I wanted to give you lots and lots of plant-forward main dish options.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And speaking of plant-forward options, all of the recipes are vegetarian and nearly all of the recipes have a vegan alternative if the recipe is not vegan already. There are a good amount of gluten-free recipes as well.</span></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/announcing-the-new-cookbook/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tagine-etc.jpg&description=The+new+Love+%26+Lemons+cookbook%2C+Love+%26+Lemons+Every+Day%2C+is+available+for+preorder%21+It%27s+packed+with+100%2B+all-new+vibrant+veggie+recipes%2C+all+the+way+from+breakfast+to+dessert.+It%27s+a+big+fat+beautiful+book%2C+and+a+fun%2C+essential+kitchen+resource.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23cookbook+%23vegetarian+%23vegan+%23recipes+")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Go-to guides</b></span><span class=s2><b><br></b></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>If you have our first cookbook, you’re probably familiar with the hummus, smoothie, and pesto charts that are at the back of the book.

Learn how to roast or grill any vegetable, how to make vegetable stock with whatever you have on hand, and more.</span></p><p><span class=s1><b>Inspiration to get creative!</b></span><span class=s2><b><br></b></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>Tired of your usual desk lunch? A giant grid of 5-ingredient salad dressings will have you devouring a new salad every day! All the dressings are wonderful to have on hand for throwing together quick meals. You’ll have a great time discovering other uses for them as well. Of course, the dressings are great to pep up your greens, but you’ll also love them on grain bowls or drizzled over roasted vegetables. As I created these dressings (and had a million dressings hanging around my fridge), I had tons of ideas of how to mix and match them to create new recipes. I hope these informative graphics spark that kind of kitchen joy for you too.</span></p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/announcing-the-new-cookbook/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/layouts.jpg&description=The+new+Love+%26+Lemons+cookbook%2C+Love+%26+Lemons+Every+Day%2C+is+available+for+preorder%21+It%27s+packed+with+100%2B+all-new+vibrant+veggie+recipes%2C+all+the+way+from+breakfast+to+dessert.+It%27s+a+big+fat+beautiful+book%2C+and+a+fun%2C+essential+kitchen+resource.+%7C+Love+and+Lemons+%23cookbook+%23vegetarian+%23vegan+%23recipes+")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Fast food </b></span><span class=s2><b><br></b></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Sometimes you just need a quick, tasty combination of healthy ingredients.

It’s loaded with positive, practical, and passionate recipes that make cooking every day a true joy, as well as endless smart tips for healthier, happier eating!”<strong>– Gail Simmons</strong>Food Expert, TV Host and Author of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bringing It Home: Favorite Recipes from a Life of Adventurous Eating</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>“Love & Lemons Every Day is going to be a new staple on my bookshelf. First of all, the recipes are SO GOOD. They’re vegetarian without sacrificing anything, and they’re totally drool-worthy (Lasagna Soup—like what??) but don’t require spending your whole night in the kitchen. Then there are the add-ins, sprinkled throughout the book like delectable little bonus morsels: How to use food scraps and freeze herbs, easy salad dressing formulas, and more.&nbsp; It’s a book that will inspire people to get excited about healthy food, but more importantly, a book that will actually enable them to cook it in their daily lives.”</span>&nbsp;<strong><span>– Liz Moody</span></strong><span>Food Director at <a href=#>mindbodygreen</a> and author of </span><span>Healthier Together</span><span>&nbsp;</span>“Being a California girl, Jeanine’s approach to food speaks deep into my heart.
