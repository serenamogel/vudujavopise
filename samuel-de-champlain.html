Although Champlain wrote extensively of his voyages and later life, little is known of his childhood. He was likely born a Protestant, but converted to Catholicism as a young adult.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">First Explorations and Voyages</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Champlain's earliest travels were with his uncle, and he ventured as far as Spain and the West Indies. From 1601 to 1603, he was a geographer for King Henry IV, and then joined François Gravé Du Pont's expedition to Canada in 1603. The group sailed up the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers and explored the Gaspé Peninsula, ultimately arriving in Montreal. Although Champlain had no official role or title on the expedition, he proved his mettle by making uncanny predictions about the network of lakes and other geographic features of the region.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Given his usefulness on Du Pont's voyage, the following year Champlain was chosen to be geographer on an expedition to Acadia led by Lieutenant-General Pierre Du Gua de Monts. They landed in May on the southeast coast of what is now Nova Scotia and Champlain was asked to choose a location for a temporary settlement. He explored the Bay of Fundy and St. John River area before selecting a small island in the St. Croix River. The team built a fort and spent the winter there.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the summer of 1605, the team sailed down the coast of New England as far south as Cape Cod. Although a few British explorers had navigated the terrain before, Champlain was the first to give a precise and detailed accounting of the region that would one day become Plymouth Rock.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Establishing Quebec</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1608, Champlain was named lieutenant to de Monts, and they set off on another expedition up the St. Lawrence. When they arrived in June 1608, they constructed a fort in what is now Quebec City. Quebec would soon become the hub for French fur trading. The following summer, Champlain fought the first major battle against the Iroquois, cementing a hostile relationship that would last for more than a century.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1615, Champlain made a brave voyage into the interior of Canada accompanied by a tribe of Native Americans with whom he had good relations, the Hurons. Champlain and the French aided the Hurons in an attack on the Iroquois, but they lost the battle and Champlain was hit in the knee with an arrow and unable to walk. He lived with the Hurons that winter, between the foot of Georgian Bay and Lake Simcoe. During his stay, he composed one of the earliest and most detailed accounts of Native American life.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Years and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Champlain returned to France, he found himself embroiled in lawsuits and was unable to return to Quebec. He spent this time writing the stories of his voyages, complete with maps and illustrations. When he was reinstated as lieutenant, he returned to Canada with his wife, who was 30 years his junior. In 1627, Louis XIII's chief minister, Cardinal de Richelieu, formed the Company of 100 Associates to rule New France and placed Champlain in charge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Things didn't go smoothly for Champlain for long. Eager to capitalize on the profitable fur trade in the region, Charles I of England commissioned an expedition under David Kirke to displace the French. They attacked the fort and seized supply ships, cutting off necessities to the colony. Champlain surrendered on July 19, 1629 and returned to France.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Champlain spent some time writing about his travels until, in 1632, the British and the French signed the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, returning Quebec to the French. Champlain returned to be its governor. By this time, however, his health was failing and he was forced to retire in 1633. He died in Quebec on Christmas Day in 1635.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Related Videos</h2><ul data-node-id=34 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Samuel de Champlain</li><li>Birth City: Brouage, Province of Saintonge</li><li>Birth Country: France</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Samuel de Champlain was a French explorer and cartographer best known for establishing and governing the settlements of New France and the city of Quebec.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Politics and Government</li><li>War and Militaries</li><li>Technology and Engineering</li></ul><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Death Year: 1635</li><li>Death date: December 25, 1635</li><li>Death City: Quebec</li><li>Death Country: Canada</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.
