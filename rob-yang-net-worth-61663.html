I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1973</span><p>Langer made his first class debut in 1973-74 for West <a href=#>Australia</a> against New Zealand, scoring 42 and 20.</p><span>1974</span><p>He began the 1974-75 season well with 41 not out and 66 against South <a href=#>Australia</a> and 62 against the touring <a href=#>English</a> side. Towards the end of the 1974-75 season, he scored his maiden first class century, 150 against Victoria, then made 72 against NSW. Some journalists said he was a possibility of the 1975 Ashes but he was not picked.</p><span>1975</span><p>In 1975-76 Langer scored 111 and 64 against NSW but was outshone by Kim Hughes' century in the latter's first class debut. He made 91 and 76 against the touring West Indians. There was instability in the <a href=#>Australian</a> team that summer; Langer was discussed as a test prospect but the selectors eventually went with Graham Yallop and Gary Cosier.</p><span>1976</span><p>Langer performed well during the 1976-77 season, including 55 and 76 against New South Wales, 77 against Victoria, 87 against <a href=#>Pakistan</a>, 52 against Victoria, 71 vs NSW and 83 against the touring <a href=#>English</a>.

However he was not able to force his way into the <a href=#>Australian</a> side.</p><span>1980</span><p>He was dropped from West <a href=#>Australia</a> in 1980-81 but forced his way back in to the side. He made 84 against the touring Indians.</p><span>1981</span><p>In the 1981-82 season he scored 140 against Queensland, and 75 against Tasmania. He also scored 99 not out in a one-day game against Tasmania, winning the man of the match award. Langer retired from first class cricket at the end of the season.</p><span>1999</span><p>After retiring from cricket, Langer went on to be Chief Executive Officer of the Western <a href=#>Australian</a> Speedway Commission from 1999 until 2001, whereupon he became a Senior Consultant.
