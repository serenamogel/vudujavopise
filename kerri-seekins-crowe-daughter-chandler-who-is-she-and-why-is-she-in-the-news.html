She is a member of the Republican Party and was elected in November 2020. She has two daughters with her husband Michael Crowe: Chandler Crowe and Ashley Crowe.</p><p>Chandler Crowe is one of Kerri Seekins Crowe’s daughters, but not much is known about her personal life or background. However, she became the subject of a controversial statement by her mother in April 2023, when Kerri Seekins Crowe said that she would rather risk her daughter’s suicide than allow her to transition to a different gender.</p><p>This statement was made during a floor debate on a bill that would ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth in Montana. Kerri Seekins Crowe argued that such care was harmful and irreversible, and that parents should have the final say over their children’s health decisions. She did not specify whether Chandler Crowe was transgender or suicidal, but she implied that she was one of the parents who had a suicidal daughter.</p><p>The statement sparked outrage and criticism from many people, including other politicians, LGBTQ+ activists, mental health experts, and online users. They accused Kerri Seekins Crowe of being insensitive, ignorant, and hateful towards transgender people and their families. They also pointed out the high rates of suicide and depression among transgender youth, and the positive effects of gender-affirming care on their well-being.</p><p>Kerri Seekins Crowe has not publicly apologized or retracted her statement, nor has she commented on how Chandler Crowe reacted to it. It is unclear whether Chandler Crowe supports or opposes her mother’s views on transgender rights and health care.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e8qeqauhXaiyprfIp6pmm6KkxKZ5w5qsoKCkmr9ur8eapZ2klad6uLTOZqCsZaOdsm6tzZ1ksKCpYra0edKhnGahnmLBqbGMp5ywq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frances-beatrix-spade-kate-spades-daughter-age-height-bio-wiki-parents-birthday.html><span>←</span><span>Frances Beatrix Spade (Kate Spades daughter) Age, Height, Bio, Wiki, Parents, Birthday</span></a>
