While each player said they would nominate themselves, Mai surprised everyone and nominated Tolbert. She didn’t roll a 6, and Tolbert in turn nominated Mai for elimination. However, she didn’t roll a 6 either.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=false>She is eliminated during the Circle of Trust game, when Phil correctly guessed who left the gift box on his desk.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlkai1rbHYZqelmamav25%2BlnFkqKZdqL62tcNmnpqllWLBqbGMnJ%2BapJyau6ixjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-burgess-married-girlfriend-brother-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Burgess Married Girlfriend Tahlia Giumelli| Insights About His Brother, Net Worth, &amp;amp; Contract</span></a>
