There are clumps. There are rice puffs and oats,” Sporked managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> wrote in her ranking of <a href=#>the best whole grain cereals</a>. “It’s almost granola—but not quite.” The flavor wowed us, too—honeyed with a hint of cinnamon. Plus, it packs 9 grams of protein per serving, so you won’t crash an hour after breakfast.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best cereal for kids" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Cereal for Kids</p><strong>Nature’s Path Organic Envirokidz Peanut Butter Panda Puffs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>When we set out to look for <a href=#>the best cereal for kids</a>, we were looking for cereals that taste really good, are fun to eat, and aren’t totally packed with sugar (okay, fine, we included some sugar-packed ones on our list, too). This Nature’s Path cereal won us over with its light crunch, sweet (but not cloying) peanut buttery flavor, and its cute-as-hell box. As Gwynedd wrote in her ranking, “It’s sweet without being absolutely packed with sugar (9 grams per serving, which I learned is reasonable in the world of fun breakfast cereal) and peanut buttery with a nice honey finish. Crispy-crunchy. Delicious. And if any child (or adult, really) can resist the adorable panda on the box, get their vitals checked!” If you see a fluffy little panda in the cereal aisle, pick him up!&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best healthy cereal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Healthy Cereal</p><strong>Special K</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>I know, I know. “Healthy cereal” is pretty vague. But when we were on the hunt for <a href=#>the best “healthy cereal,”</a> we were simply looking for accessible options that taste good and aren’t egregiously awful for us. Special K might not be a nutritionist’s idea of a “health” food, but it’s lower in sugar than other cereals—and, most importantly, it tastes good. As Gwynedd wrote in her ranking, “Of all the cereals we tried that come in flake form, this was the absolute best overall, thanks to a winning combo of rice, wheat, and barley that tastes great and stands up nicely to milk.” If you want a burst of berry flavor, we recommend slicing up your own rather than relying on the sugary freeze-dried berries that come in some boxes of Special K.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best chocolate cereal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Chocolate Cereal</p><strong>Cocoa Pebbles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>It’s kind of lame how many chocolate cereals don’t taste all that much like chocolate. Cocoa Pebbles, however, live up to their chocolatey promise. “The box promises that Cocoa Pebbles ‘[turn] milk chocolatey’ and they weren’t kidding,” Sporked senior writer <a href=#>Jordan Myrick</a> wrote in their ranking of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best chocolate cereal</a>. “The milk in our tasting bowl became brown moments after adding the Cocoa Pebbles.” If you want a chocolate cereal that’s downright desserty, this is for you.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fruity cereal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Fruity Cereal</p><strong>Fruity Pebbles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>We’re big Pebbles fans here at Sporked, so when we taste tested <a href=#>fruity cereals</a>, it wasn’t a huge surprise when Fruity Pebbles was the best cereal we tried. “If you saw our ranking of the best chocolate cereals, you know we lost our absolute minds for Cocoa Pebbles,” Jordan wrote. “These little flakes are so crunchy and light. The flavor is super fruity and the smell is utterly intoxicating to a cereal lover.” That big, fruity flavor and aroma gave this one an edge over Trix, Froot Loops, Apple Jacks, and other childhood breakfast faves.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best fiber cereal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Fiber Cereal</p><strong>Cascadian Farm Organic Hearty Morning Fiber Cereal</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>With a name like “Hearty Morning Fiber,” this cereal from Cascadian Farm has to be good for the ol’ constitution. It doesn’t pack as much fiber as some other cereals on the list (10 grams versus 18 grams in Fiber One Original, for instance), but this one manages to be high fiber, taste really good, and pack a lot of different textures. “Each box contains a mix of lightly sweet whole wheat flakes, nutty bran sticks, and delightfully crunchy granola clusters,” Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> wrote in her ranking of <a href=#>the best fiber cereal</a>. It’s crunchy, filling, and one of the best cereals you can buy if you’re looking to give your digestive system a boost.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best keto cereal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Keto Cereal</p><strong>Catalina Crunch Cinnamon Toast Keto Friendly Cereal</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>Abiding by a keto diet doesn’t have to mean cutting out cereal. But proceed with caution: A lot of the low-carb cereals are not worth your breakfast bucks. During <a href=#>our taste test</a>, we were looking for keto cereals that could trick us into thinking they weren’t keto cereals, and that’s how Cataline Crunch Cinnamon Toast ended up in the top spot. “It’s crunchy like a good cereal should be, so it can withstand the addition of milk and won’t promptly get soggy,” Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo wrote. “There’s less sugar than in regular Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but the toasted, cinnamony notes are just wonderful.” It was the only keto cereal someone brought home after the taste test.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best trader joe's" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-08.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best TJ’s Cereal</p><strong>Just the Clusters Maple Pecan Granola Cereal</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>There’s a lot to choose from in the Trader Joe’s cereal aisle, but this hearty, mapel-y granola (with flakes!) won everyone over. We thought maple granola cereal might hew a little sweet for our tastes, but that wasn’t the case at all. This has a great balance of flavors, and the sweetness of the granola clusters is offset by the earthy bitterness of the pecans. Jordan even suggested it would be a “luxurious spa day breakfast” with some yogurt, sliced banana, and honey. And it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from TJ’s</a>, so it’s the kind of luxury that comes cheap.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon&nbsp;</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best granola" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-09.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Granola</p><strong>Purely Elizabeth Original Ancient Grain Granola</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>If you’re looking for the perfect granola—no flakes, just straight-up granola—Purely Elizabeth has you covered. Yes, the brand’s name sounds like a Jodi Picoult novel or something, but they know granola. “Of all the packaged granolas we tasted, this one from Purely Elizabeth came the closest to resembling what you’d get in a fruit-scattered parfait at a nice breakfast spot,” Gwynedd wrote in her ranking of <a href=#>the best granolas</a>. “This bag is full of plump clusters of salty-sweet oats and grains (amaranth, quinoa, chia seeds), and a hint of cinnamon that compliments that natural sweetness of coconut sugar.” This one has French toast vibes and we love.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best magic spoon cereal" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AGGREGATED-RANKING_CEREAL_INSET-10.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Magic Spoon</p><strong>Magic Spoon Fruity</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Magic Spoon</a><p>If you exist on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, you’ve probably been served an ad for Magic Spoon cereal somewhere between one and five million times. And if you happen to enjoy cereal, you’ve probably been intrigued by its cute packaging, fun flavors, and promise of high protein and no sugar. But when we sat down to taste test <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every flavor of Magic Spoon</a> we could get our hands on, Fruity was our favorite by far. “These little hoops of milk protein, oil, and tapioca starch have that precise citrusy tang that sends you back to elementary school,” Gwynedd wrote. “It’s the definition of a fun breakfast, presumably minus the sugar crash.” If you’ve been looking for a low-sugar cereal that won’t make breakfast a bummer, this is a great option.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Magic Spoon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite cereal with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFur8SrnJqkXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-things-you-didnt-know-about-aj-johnson.html><span>←</span><span>8 Things You Didnt Know About AJ Johnson</span></a>
