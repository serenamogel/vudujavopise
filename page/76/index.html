Welp. The Phillies' scheduled home-and-home series with the New York Yankees is officially postponed, which means Philadelphia won't have any baseball to watch until Friday at the earliest.
In honor of baseball being yanked so quickly from our lives, we thought we'd put together a photo gallery of the Phillie Phanatic looking sad and lonely in an empty ballpark this past weekend. It just seemed to fit the mood.

In today‚Äôs era of overstuffed action movies and raunchy comedies, the epic Hollywood love story is mostly a thing of the past. There was a time, however, when it was a moviegoing staple. Starting with Gone with the Wind, which set the standard for the genre back in 1939, historical romances on a monumental scale were big business for decades. Even by the mid-60s, when the Hollywood studio system was beginning to crumble, an epic love story could still command an epic audience.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>No Ordinary Love | You Me (Pink and Dallas Green) Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos</h2><time>Jan 29, 2024</time>

Performance: Intel's Outgoing Calpella Platform
Okay, we've set the stage for the performance metrics, and again it's important to note that we are intentionally reviewing a bog-standard Dell Arrandale/Calpella platform. Intel wanted us to have a reference point for a good Arrandale setup for the arrival of Sandy Bridge, and that meant sticking with the Intel IGP and CPU. It's not a bad combination, but if Anand's desktop Sandy Bridge preview is any indication, we're about to see some significant increases in both CPU and GPU performance, all without dramatically affecting battery life‚Äîand if we're lucky, battery life might even improve.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/75/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
