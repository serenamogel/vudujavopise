<a href=../../rare-photo-shows-jeanclaude-van-damme-original-predator.html></a>
One of the most famous pieces of trivia regarding John McTiernan’s action classic Predator was that unknown martial artist Jean-Claude Van Damme was hired to play the title character, with the original design for the intergalactic trophy hunter seemingly ideal for someone with his particular set of skills to turn the alien killer into an agile and ninja-like nemesis for the intrepid band of heroes.
Recommended Videos At the time, the Muscles from Brussels only had a handful of feature film credits under his belt, and Predator would have marked his first major Hollywood production, with the movie releasing in theaters eight months before Van Damme’s breakout starring vehicle Bloodsport.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Audrey Grace Marshall leads the Fairly Oddparents: Fairly Odder cast</h2><time>Mar 28, 2024</time>

<a href=../../counterpoint-1968.html></a>
Unhappily, Welles is nowhere in sight, and "Counterpoint" is not a Gothic thriller but a war movie. And what a war movie it is.
Get this: A symphony orchestra is on a USO tour when it's lured behind German lines and captured. Its conductor (Charlton Heston) is a stern idealist who also has a thing going with the cute little cellist, who is married to the concertmaster.
The SS colonel is all for shooting the orchestra right away.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How tall is Lauren Vlez</h2><time>Mar 28, 2024</time>
