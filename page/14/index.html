Launching today will be a single GTX 580 design, the reference design.

And while we’re on that note, NVIDIA let us know that with their focus on cooling on the GTX 580 they aren’t going to be letting custom GTX 580 designs go out without a more thorough inspection.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Beanie Bubble movie review (2023)</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>
