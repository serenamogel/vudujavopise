Keq = 1, which indicates that the location of equilibrium is in the middle, and that the number of products at equilibrium is about equal to the amount of reactants. If Keq is a small number (for example, if Keq = 10-3), then the location of equilibrium is to the left, indicating that there are more reactants present at equilibrium than at the starting point.
What does KEQ stand for, then, in light of all of this?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mathew Nooch- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Nationality, Career</h2><time>Mar 4, 2024</time>
