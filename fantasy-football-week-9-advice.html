Downs is trending to play but I'm afraid he will be limited or a last min scratch. — Steve B.</strong></p><p>Generally love Downs, but given the circumstances, for today I’m starting Pop Douglas.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I take a gamble with Josh Downs at less than 100 percent, or play Khalil Shakir? — Michael F.</strong></p><p>Second verse, the same as the first. Generally love Downs, but given the circumstances, for today I’m starting Khalil Shakir.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Again, DON'T bench Kupp</h2><p><strong>Q: Where does the combination of Brett Rypien and the decent GB matchup leave Cooper Kupp? Even if the target volume is high is he realistically anything more than a low-end WR2? — James B.</strong></p><p>Cooper Kupp is likely not realistically more than a low-end WR2, but that still leaves most players no choice. It takes a special roster to bench Kupp.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">We need some explosive plays</h2><p><strong>Q: Pick one to start: Marquise Brown, Rashee Rice or Christian Watson? — Anonymous</strong></p><p>Christian Watson by a nose with the highest chance for a game-breaking play.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Stick it out with Mattison</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Stick it out with Mattison" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Michael Owens / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Q: Twelve-team PPR ... Alexander Mattison or Brian Robinson? Gross I know … — Drake O.</strong></p><p>I feel your pain, brother. Hold your nose and start Alexander Mattison; he’s managed to control the workload despite Cam Akers nipping at his heels.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Rhamondre all the way</h2><p><strong>Q: Rhamondre Stevenson or Brian Robinson in full PPR against each other? — Johnny R.</strong></p><p>Rhamondre by a country mile cmon! Have faith in the draft capital you spent.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Who's the best buy-low in fantasy right now?</h2><p><strong>Q: Half-point PPR: Rank Tee Higgins, Jakobi Meyers and Nico Collins? — Adam C.</strong></p><p>As a man of the people, I provide my personal ranks at the top of these Q&A sessions so I’m going to agree with … myself.</p><p>Nico Collins popped in my projections against a pass funnel in Tampa, with Tee Higgins behind him. The Bengals have every conceivable arrow pointing up right now heading into a potential shootout if game totals are any indication. Higgins has just a few hours left as the best buy-low in fantasy football.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Chris Godwin's target rates make him a good option at the Flex</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Chris Godwin's target rates make him a good option at the Flex" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Kevin Sabitus / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Q: Flex Chris Godwin or Tank Dell? Half PPR. — Trevor M.</strong></p><p>Roll with the projections and Chris Godwin. Don’t get me wrong, I’m high on the Texans and Tank Dell going forward. However, on a week-to-week basis, the emergence of Noah Brown is a thorn in the side of anyone starting Dell. Those 4-5 targets every game had been going to Dell earlier in the year.</p><p>I’d prefer Godwin who is most likely going to be playing from behind as the second-highest target earner on his team.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Singletary for six</h2><p><strong>Q: Darrell Henderson or Devin Singletary? Non-PPR league. — Jake S.</strong></p><p>Non-PPR means prioritize touchdowns, so I’m starting Devin Singletary on the more highly projected team and Dameon Pierce OUT. Despite the Texans’ recent struggles, I believe in C.J. Stroud to bounce back and pave the way for an RB1 finish from Singletary.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Breakout Rhamondre game incoming</h2><p><strong>Q: Flex Rhamondre Stevenson or Jahan Dotson? Who would stack well with Sam Howell? — Colin U.</strong></p><p>I’m projecting a breakout Rhamondre game coming against the Commanders today. Washington’s defense played poorly before trading their best two players on the same day. I’m expecting little to no pressure on a Patriots team that should turn to their best player today.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Is the Renfrow resurgence happening?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Is the Renfrow resurgence happening?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Q: I feel like a Hunter Renfrow resurgence is coming under the new coaching regime in Las Vegas. Anything to it, and is this week too early? — Ron C.</strong></p><p>No one loves speculating on fantasy assets more than I do, but I just don’t see the surrounding contextual environment needed to support yet another player in Las Vegas. There’s a rookie QB under center with established superstars to feed. Hunter Renfrow would have to be extremely efficient to make it happen.</p><p>I’d prefer Buffalo’s Khalil Shakir in a similar spot.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Ride the Trey McBride train</h2><p><strong>Q: Keep riding Trey McBride, or play it safer with Logan Thomas? — Jonny Q.</strong></p><p>Definitely ride with Trey McBride. No team in the league has targeted the tight end position more than ARI and Kyler Murray could be back as soon as next week. McBride’s playing every down and earning tons of targets which is all you can ask for from a fantasy TE.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Stop with the Packers questions!</h2><p><strong>Q: Flex options are Chuba Hubbard, Aaron Jones or Christian Watson. What do we think? — Josh S.</strong></p><p>As a huge preseason Green Bay backer, these Packer questions are killing me, Josh. Fantasy’s a game of maximizing the shortest samples so I’m sticking with my projections and starting Chuba. The Panthers have shown some life off the bye as Hubbard usurped all of Carolina’s high-value touches. Until we see anything from Jordan Love and sitting all Cheeseheads.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Drop the Eagles defense</h2><p><strong>Q: Ten-team standard: Should I drop the Eagles defense for the rest of the year? — Josh S.</strong></p><p>Yes, I would move on from the Eagles defense. They have an upcoming bye and a very hard schedule on the horizon (DAL, BYE, @KC, BUF, SF, @DAL, @SEA).</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">You can start Hubbard, Stevenson with confidence</h2><p><strong>Q: Ugh … I have to start two of three of these RB’s in my PPR league: Kareem Hunt, Chuba Hubbard or Rhamondre Stevenson. — Tom D.</strong></p><p>Fret not, you’re going to love this one, Tom! Ok fine, it’s partly a function of bye weeks and a decimated running back landscape but I have Chuba Hubbard and Rhamondre Stevenson in RB1 territory this week. Start them both with confidence today. I’m recommending anyone rostering Kareem Hunt take a wait-and-see approach with Jerome Ford returning.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Kareem Hunt or Darrell Henderson?</h2><p><strong>Q: PPR RB: Kareem Hunt or Darrell Henderson? — Jim S.</strong></p><p>Despite the backup QB in Los Angeles, I’m sticking with Darrell Henderson, especially in PPR. Inexperienced quarterbacks often fall back on check-down passes when facing any sort of pressure. Plus Henderson’s in line for whatever little touchdown equity there is today whereas I’m assuming Jerome Ford reassumes the lead role after logging a full practice.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Don't eat a zero on Downs</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Don't eat a zero on Downs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Michael Hickey / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Q: Do I play Josh Downs (possibly out with a knee injury) or play Demario Douglas or Tank Dell? Then same question, but with Trey McBride as a replacement for Downs. — David L. & Scott S.</strong></p><p>I can’t stand the idea of eating a zero so I wouldn’t start Josh Downs without confirmation. Demario Douglas gets pushed to the fore as the expected team target leader in NE heading into a plus matchup. I’m starting Pop Douglas universally. Tank Dell’s a nice piece but will be limited so long as Noah Brown continues to eat into those opportunities.</p><p>Load more updates</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46fmKeskajGbrLOqKubmZyherixxKRkcmWRmcOqr8RohIqkl4%2FGsLTOk5mMZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./claudia-christian-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html><span>←</span><span>Claudia Christian | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</span></a>
