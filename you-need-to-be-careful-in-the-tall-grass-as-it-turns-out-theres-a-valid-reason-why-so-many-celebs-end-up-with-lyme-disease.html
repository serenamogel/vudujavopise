The reason why? They can wreak havoc on your system without you ever knowing it, leading to months and even years of painful symptoms, untraceable disease, and debilitating illness that ‚Äî if found too late ‚Äî can be devastating. When a recent&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>TikTok</strong></a>&nbsp;user @Sheena asked why so many celebs seem to get <strong>Lyme disease</strong>, user @richardjosephjordan responded with a response that makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-why-does-it-seem-like-many-celebrities-have-battled-a-lyme-disease-diagnosis data-injectable=false>Why does it seem like many celebrities have battled a Lyme disease diagnosis?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@richardjosephjordan href=#>@richardjosephjordan</a><p>You need to be careful in the tall grass. @Sheena <a title=ticks href=#>#ticks</a> <a title=lymedisease href=#>#lymedisease</a> <a title=easthampton href=#>#Easthampton</a> <a title=hamptons href=#>#hamptons</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Richard Jordan" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Richard Jordan</a></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Richard Jordan offered an explanation alongside a brief history lesson about where Lyme disease originated and why that likely plays a part in a celebrity diagnosis. You might be wondering why Jordan felt compelled to respond to the TikTok and why people are responding to his video as he‚Äôs not a medical professional.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Jordan offers up the fact that he, too, has had Lyme disease, and those with rare diseases know how impossible it can seem to find information on the illness, ways to combat it, and support for those who will suffer from debilitating side effects for some time.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Jordan first shows a photo of a deer tick (and if it made you nauseous, you‚Äôre not alone) before explaining that this particular type of tick is one that bites animals and humans, spreading Lyme disease.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>He then notes that Lyme disease was first discovered in Lyme, CT, in the mid-1970s. At first, no one could pinpoint the reason patients were presenting with symptoms of Lyme disease, but it was eventually linked to tick bites.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Jordan then shows a map of where cases of Lyme have been diagnosed (although it‚Äôs believed that many people have Lyme disease without a proper diagnosis), and many correlate with the northeastern US, specifically in the area near ‚Äî you guessed it, Lyme, CT.</p><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>The Hamptons is a popular vacation spot for celebrities across many genres; entertainment, sports, music ‚Äî it‚Äôs a place to relax and get out of the spotlight. It‚Äôs a high-value attraction for them, and the area there is prime for ticks. There‚Äôs a lot of sand and tall grass, which ticks often cling to. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamptons Mouthpiece</a>&nbsp;even has an informational piece about the presence of ticks in their area and the diseases they‚Äôve seen more of in the years since the discovery of Lyme.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>Bella Hadid, Justin Bieber, Ben Stiller, Shania Twain, and Avril Lavigne, among many others, have been open about their Lyme disease diagnosis and how the awful symptoms and side effects have caused many things in their lives to change.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true><a title=@the.tiser href=#>@the.tiser</a><p>Bella Hadid is stepping back from modelling amid her painful health battle Lyme disease ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π <a title=bellahadid href=#>#bellahadid</a> <a title=lymedisease href=#>#lymedisease</a> <a title=model href=#>#model</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - The Advertiser" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì The Advertiser</a></figure><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a>&nbsp;reports that around 30,000 cases of Lyme are reported each year. However, with other surveillance methods, some believe the number is closer to 476,000.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>As someone who suffers from tick-borne illness myself, the literature out there for those of us who struggle is hard to find. A current Alpha-gal syndrome diagnosis and a history of Lyme disease have riddled my body, and awareness of the illnesses is so important. It took months in both cases to find out the reason behind so many scary symptoms, and if you were to ask anyone you know with Lyme disease or read stories about those who have it ‚Äî they‚Äôll often say the same.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>It‚Äôs necessary to know where ticks live, what they can do to you, how to protect yourself from a tick bite, or what steps to take if one has already bitten you. Even on the beaches of the Hamptons, with beautiful sand and tall grass, it‚Äôs important to remember to use bug spray and wear clothes that help make tick bites less frequent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8urvUZqWenZRiwbB5wZ5knJmimrO2uIyipWasmJp6ta3LpWSgqpGowG6t0magrWWkqr%2Bvv4yorK1lpJ2ys7HSZphmrpGhtqV50Z6YrKeeYsSpxYyspmalkaPGbq%2FEpZybq12au6V51KlksKGknXqtxcyeZJ2ho5qutLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-complex-anime-power-systems.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Ranking the 11 Most Complex Anime Power Systems</span></a>
