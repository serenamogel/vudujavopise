This means our favorite Cars star will feel taller and wider than we see on screen.</p><p data-injection=true>This makes a huge difference in gameplay, as Rocket League is about finesse. Being able to predict exactly how your car will interact with the ball is absolutely crucial to making plays.</p><p>As an avid Octane player, it’s easy to tell the difference when playing with a car that uses any other hitbox. The oversized dimensions tend to make routine actions more complicated. Stuff like collecting boost pads or half-flipping affects your muscle memory, and it’s not the kind of thing you want to be surprised by.</p><h2 id=1-why-are-hitboxes-important-in-rocket-league>Why are Hitboxes important in Rocket League?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lightning-McQueen-in-game-Rocket-League.jpg><p>Hitboxes are the in-game measurements that make up your car’s body type. Each vehicle in Rocket League is assigned one, with many of them operating off either the Octane, Dominus, or Fennec variations. This means no matter how a car looks, if it’s using the Dominus hitbox, it will operate the same as the Dominus would in every scenario.</p><p data-injection=true>Lightning McQueen’s Dominus hitbox is made up of these Unreal Unit dimensions, the in-engine measurement system that makes up the entire game.</p><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> 127.93</li><li><strong>Width:</strong> 83.28</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> 31.3</li></ul><p>If you’re unfamiliar with the various kinds of hitboxes in Rocket League, <a href=#>check out our guide</a> here.
