After Wednesday got expelled from the school she was previously enrolled in, she was forced to transfer somewhere new.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>At Nevermore Academy, she was given the chance to be surrounded by other students with mythical powers. While it’s true that Wednesday fits in better at Nevermore than any other school she used to attend, it was easier for her to make the transition because she wasn’t inherently close with her mother.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wednesday Addams acts repulsed by her parents in ‘Wednesday’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Netflix US (@netflix)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Throughout Season 1 of Wednesday, the title character vocalizes the fact that she wants to be nothing like her mother. She doesn’t aim to turn out like her mother because she doesn’t believe in true love the way Morticia and Gomez believe in it. Wednesday makes rude and snide comments about her mother to point out Morticia’s weaknesses at every possible chance she gets.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Whenever something positive about Morticia comes to light (such as her determination or optimistic outlook on life), Wednesday views those things as unflattering and embarrassing. Morticia does everything in her power to build a close relationship with Wednesday, but she’s always met with angsty teenage resistance.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=false>It seems that the producers of Wednesday are planting the seeds now to create a heartfelt and close-knit relationship between Wednesday and Morticia down the line in later seasons. They might not have the best connection now, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for growth. Morticia is the type of mother who is never going to give up trying –– no matter how hard it might be for her to deal with an emotionless daughter like Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6ido6PBbsPEnaWeq5SWxm6tw52YpqtdnLK1ecClpqefXay2tbSMpqarrJmYtqJ5wJ2bmqWjYravedaem6edo5muunnOp2SnnaSbuarEjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./running-wild-the-life-of-dayton-o-hyde-2013.html><span>←</span><span>Running Wild: The Life of Dayton O.
