She was the first Muslim Arab news presenter on mainstream Hebrew-language Israeli television. Tsahi and Lucy kept their relationship a secret until their marriage (in a private ceremony on October 10, 2018) due to fear of harassment. This was because such marriages (between Jewish-Israelis and Arab-Israelis) can attract a lot of negativity due to the decades-old and ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. Although many congratulated the couple on their marriage, a member of the Knesset (the unicameral legislature of Israel) criticized it – calling it ‘assimilation’. Lucy and Tsahi have a son together named Adam Aharish Halevi (b. March 2021).</li><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>White</p><p>He is of Sephardic Jewish descent.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Dark Brown</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Light Brown</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Side-parted, wavy hair</li><li>Sports a rugged beard</li></ul><h3>Religion</h3><p>Judaism</p><figure id=attachment_484054 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-484054 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Tsahi Halevi as seen in an Instagram Post in September 2022 (Tsahi Halevi / Instagram)</figure><h3>Tsahi Halevi Facts</h3><li>Tsahi spent his childhood crisscrossing many countries because his father was working in the Israeli prime minister’s office during that time.</li><li>In 1999, he joined the Mayumana troupe, an Israeli group that combines dance with singing and percussion.
