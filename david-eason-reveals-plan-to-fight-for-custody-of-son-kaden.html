His&nbsp; mother is on drugs and has kept him from me for a long time trying to hide her bad habits,”</p><p>Recently, David posted pictures to his Instagram story with the caption, “When the best moments are missed for years on end because of a grudge, you know you’re obsessively controlling!”</p><p><a href=#>The Sun</a> reported he wrote an additional post that read, “Just a few more months and I will have my son back in my arms!&nbsp; It’s been too long!&nbsp; I never knew anyone could be so cold hearted to alienate my son from me but the truth always comes out and justice prevails!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/David-Eason.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/David-Eason-2.jpg><h2>David’s troubled past</h2><p>David’s ex-girlfriend Olivia has worried in the past about Kaden being around David’s volatile behavior.&nbsp; David’s temper has landed him in several different troublesome situations.</p><p>Last October, Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans filed a protective order against David in order to protect herself and her children.</p><p>According to <a href=#>E! News</a>, Jenelle cited various incidents of alleged abuse and claimed she was scared for the safety of herself and for her children.&nbsp; She stated in court documents, “Because of his recent threats, his history of violence, his erratic behavior and his large stockpile of weapons, I am scared for my life and my children’s well-being.”</p><p>Jenelle also claimed David threatened her and said, “You can die for all I care. You’re a piece of s**t. Biggest piece of s**t I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Eventually, Jenelle wanted the order dropped as she and David sought out couples counseling and made amends.</p><p data-pw-in-article=true>Following the issue with the protective order, David was arrested and faced felony assault charges for <a href=#>pistol-whipping one of Jenelle’s friends</a>&nbsp;when he came with her to pick up some of her belongings from their home.</p><p data-pw-in-article=true>Despite yet another act of violence, Jenelle once again made up with David and continued their relationship.</p><h2>Jenelle fired from MTV because of David</h2><p>David’s violent track record eventually got Jenelle fired from the Teen Mom 2 franchise after <a href=#>he shot and killed their family dog.</a></p><p>MTV released the statement, “MTV ended its relationship with David Eason over a year ago in February 2018 and has not filmed any new episodes of Teen Mom 2 with him since. Additionally, we have stopped filming with Jenelle Eason as of April 6, 2019, and have no plans to cover her story in the upcoming season.”</p><p>David defended his actions and claimed he shot the dog in order to protect their daughter Ensley.&nbsp; The dog reportedly bit her in the face and David felt the dog could never be trusted around his children again.</p><p>David fears for Kaden’s safety with his mother Olivia, yet he himself has a lengthy history of alleged violence.&nbsp; As David seeks full custody of his son, it’s unclear how his violent past will affect his case.</p><p>Teen Mom 2 airs Tuesdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5SWw6qwjJ6YrKeeYr%2BmwsSao6xloKGur3nTqGSfoZedwW6yzqtknK2jqbylxYyonWarn6N6rK3DnqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beavis-and-butt-head-do-the-universe-movie-review-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe movie review (2022)</span></a>
