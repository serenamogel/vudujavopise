<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Muppet Treasure Island movie review (1996)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><i>Treasure Island</i> was made into four films between 1934 and 1990, with Long John Silver played by Wallace Berry, Robert Newton (the best), <a href=#>Charlton Heston</a> and <a href=#>Orson Welles</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old peg-legged scoundrel has even spun off a chain of fast food restaurants.</p><p>The original Stevenson version has been so thoroughly updated, retreaded and revised, indeed, that it was probably only a matter of time until the Muppets got to it. After the success of "<a href=#>The Muppet Christmas Carol</a>" (1992), the heirs to <a href=#>Jim Henson</a> must have seen the road ahead: Take famous family stories and recast them with a mixture of humans and Muppets. How can it fail?</p><p>Basically, it can't. "Muppet Treasure Island," directed by <a href=#>Brian Henson</a>, son of the late Muppet genius, will entertain you more or less in proportion to your affection for the Muppets. If you like them, you'll probably like this. In the democratic tradition that has distinguished Muppet movies from the start, the credits list Muppets and humans interchangeably, in the order of the size of their roles, and so we note that the movie stars <a href=#>Tim Curry</a> as Long John Silver, Kermit the Frog as Captain Smollett, <a href=#>Kevin Bishop</a> as young Jim Hawkins and <a href=#>Miss Piggy</a> as Benjamina Gunn.</p><p>The story: An old salt named Flint buries untold treasure on an island. Young Jim is given a map to the treasure, and sets sail (with the Great Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat) to find it. Kermit's character captains the ship, and also on board is Curry, as Long John Silver. Once on the island, they find, as in most film versions of the story, that Flint has left someone behind.</p><p>In most versions, it's Ben Gunn. In this one, its Benjamina Gunn, played with her usual panache by Miss Piggy, who is queen of the island's warthogs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mrKmolal6tb7EmqquqpVitrS4wKebZmlpboM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-bernthal-punisher-all-we-know-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Bernthals Return As Punisher: All We Know</span></a>
