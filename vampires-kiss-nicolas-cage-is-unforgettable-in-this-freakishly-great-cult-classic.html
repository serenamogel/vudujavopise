Nicolas Cage’s performance in the freakishly great 1989 cult classic Vampire’s Kiss transcends language and exposes the limitations of human vocabulary, entering a space sometimes rationalised with the defeatist turn of phrase: “there are no words”.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>If that sounds a bit much, why not watch the film’s famous <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">alphabet scene</a> and have a crack at describing it yourself? You’ll probably gravitate towards words like “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">madness</a>”, “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">batshit</a>”, “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">bonkers</a>”, “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">hilarious</a>”, “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">unhinged</a>” and “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">offbeat</a>”, as others have. If you feel the need to use the words “over-the-top”, which have frequently been applied to this film and Cage’s style more broadly, you are missing the point and should go and sit in the naughty corner.</p><figure id=2452ef1f-3fad-476c-8afe-e4faaf7d06b2 data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>I once would have been embarrassed by my love for Wayne’s World – but no longer | Katharine PollockRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>The great actor memorably responded to this demeaning description by emphasising his role as a creator of realities, rather than an artist beholden to just one, telling <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Variety in 2017</a>: “You show me where the top is, and I’ll let you know whether I’m over it or not … I design where the top is.”</p><figure id=ac8232ab-9ced-4ba1-91cc-0095c5523cbe data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1alawo7></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>The trailer for Vampire’s Kiss.</span></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>Cage plays Peter Loew, a literary agent who is bitten by a vampire and spirals into madness. The film opens with Peter speaking to his psychiatrist (Elizabeth Ashley), who, like us, is captivated and unnerved by him. Early on, Peter takes a woman home from a bar, but a bat flies into the room, killing the vibe and planting the first seeds of a monster movie. Things get more explicitly genrefied when another lover – a vampire, played by Jennifer Beals – sinks her fangs into Peter.</p><ul class=dcr-epamsi><li class=dcr-epamsi><p class=dcr-epamsi><a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li></ul><p class=dcr-epamsi>The person who cops the brunt of Peter’s intensity is his secretary Alva (María Conchita Alonso). In fact, Vampire’s Kiss becomes a portrait of workplace abuse in the form of a very, very black comedy; screenwriter Joseph Minion makes the point that monsters take many forms, including privileged men. Peter gives Alva monotonous tasks to do, makes her the target of long and demeaning monologues, screams her name repeatedly, chases her through the workplace, and even arrives at her house when she calls in sick to menace her some more, under the guise of calling a truce (although the nastiness is entirely one-sided).</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1ki5f>Sign up to <span>Saved for Later</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The actor treats the camera as a funhouse mirror, reflecting insane distortions of himself and others, and the sets as laboratories in which to experiment with performative styles – some inspired by German expressionism, I think, and others impossible to categorise. Vampire’s Kiss is the greatest Nicolas Cage movie (which is not the same as saying the greatest movie with Nicolas Cage in it) and I have <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">seen and written about</a> every one of them.</p><figure id=c24bf0cb-d6ac-4a8e-9d97-7bbb92f871b8 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl></figure><p class=dcr-epamsi>The film invites the question of whether Peter really is a vampire or merely thinks he is. Towards the end he buys a set of fake vampire teeth, lugs around a plank of wood and begs strangers on the street to kill him with it and has a conversation with a marble pillar on the street, thinking it is his psychiatrist. At one point Cage <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">eats a live cockroach</a>, for real; the actor came up with his idea himself, stating in the DVD commentary: “I really [wanted] to do something that would shock the audience, something you would never forget.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>That proved an understatement: Cage did many things the audience would never forget in Vampire’s Kiss. His involvement both a blessing and a curse for director Robert Bierman – mostly a blessing, because Cage canonised the film and made it great, subverting a midnight movie into sheer performative spectacle. He’s a curse in the sense Bierman’s authorship has been overridden; there’s a reason I’m only mentioning the director now.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>This speaks to the power of Cage who, at his peak, is so distinctive a performer that he becomes the main author or co-author of a work, challenging the hegemony of the auteur system. As the designer of where the top is, Cage reminds us that, just as realism is only one way to think about on-screen representation, categorising films by the auteur system is merely one prism through which to view authorship. Long may he challenge, provoke, perplex, astonish, astound.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ6Zobpwfo9raWiZpZx8c4COr5imqJmnsrR5yqKqrGWenrCwuMCsZJyZl5p6qr%2BMrqWfp6KcsrXAwJujnmWZo3q1tMisZJ%2BqlZa4qr%2FHpbBmn6KarrV5wq6jrWWToa60v8ic</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amd-ryzen-7-8700g-and-ryzen-5-8600g-review.html><span>←</span><span>iGPU Gaming Performance: 720p And Lower</span></a>
