He had served six months in prison for allegedly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-09-12-mn-21488-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="piloting an airplane with a half-ton of marijuana aboard" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>piloting an airplane with a half-ton of marijuana aboard</u></a> from South America to Kentucky in 1979 as part of a drug- and gun-importing and distribution ring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The day of the 1985 jump, he was flying from Colombia on a Cessna 404 loaded with cocaine. After <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960158,00.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dropping 200 pounds of cocaine by parachute" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>dropping 200 pounds of cocaine by parachute</u></a> over Georgia, Thornton leapt from the aircraft over Tennessee and apparently became entangled in his own parachute. The 40-year-old died from the fall, and the plane, itself, later crashed into a mountain in western North Carolina.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It would take some time before authorities could piece together exactly what happened, but in its account of Thornton’s dramatic death, Time magazine noted that drug smugglers were increasingly resorting to desperate measures to evade radar technology from federal authorities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“In some extreme cases, the crew members put the plane on automatic pilot, dump the drugs, and bail out,” Time’s John S. Demott <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,960158-1,00.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote in 1985" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote in 1985</a>. “Once on the ground, they locate the contraband by tuning to the radio signals from the parachuted cargo. The plane crashes when it runs out of fuel.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That’s not exactly how it goes down in Cocaine Bear, though. Screenwriter Jimmy Warden told USA Today that Banks opted to simply have Thornton get accidentally knocked out while departing from the plane. Warden said, “It’s quicker and more efficient to tell the story if the guy just hits his head and passes out. And also way funnier.”</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Who Was Andrew Thornton?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thornton’s upbringing wasn’t typical of a career criminal. Born in 1944, to a well-off family and raised on a thoroughbred farm in Bourbon County, Kentucky, he joined the U.S. Army and trained—somewhat ironically—as a paratrooper. Thornton earned a Purple Heart during U.S. intervention in the Dominican Civil War in 1965, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/10/20/drew-thorntons-last-adventure/982df601-7c8c-4955-a09c-b6d1f3b0a426/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to The Washington Post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>according to </u><u>The Washington Post</u></a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his time in the Army, Thornton became a police officer in Lexington, Kentucky, and joined—again, somewhat ironically—the narcotics squad in the 1970s, working on investigations with the local arm of the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to The Washington Post. He also attended law school at night and received a law degree in 1976, though he never practiced law.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thornton loved adrenaline rushes and the thrill of danger, and he soon became bored with police work and became a drug smuggler. One DEA agent who previously worked with Thornton called him a “007 paramilitary type personality,” according to The Washington Post, while an FBI agent described him as “a little boy who never grew up.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“He believed he was an ‘impeccable warrior,’” Betty Zairing, Thornton’s ex-wife, told The Washington Post in 1985. “He was a philosophical, incredibly disciplined, extremely spiritual, and loyal warrior, with his own code of ethics, who thrived on excitement.”</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">What Was Andrew Thornton’s Life Like?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thornton was exceedingly eccentric and paranoid, and his short life was filled with stories as bizarre and colorful as that of his death. He regularly carried a gun, claimed to be a martial arts master, bragged about killing a German shepherd with his bare hands, and described himself as an expert at skydiving from heights of below 2,000 feet, according to The Washington Post.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thornton owned an isolated farm in Jessamine County, Kentucky, that he called Triad, which he surrounded with barbed wire, barracks, and trenches. Kentucky State Police repeatedly surveilled it in response to reports of guerilla warfare training for mercenaries, though Thornon denied any such activity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While awaiting trial in 1982 on his criminal charges, Thornton was shot twice in the chest at close range while leaving a restaurant in Lexington. He was unharmed thanks to a bulletproof vest, and authorities later determined Thornton staged the shooting himself to fool the judge into believing his life would be in danger if he were imprisoned, according to The Washington Post.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">How Thornton would have felt about his untimely death and less-than-flattering portrayal in Cocaine Bear is anybody’s guess. But there are some who feel it was the most appropriate way for him to go.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I’m glad his parachute didn’t open,” Brian Leighton, an assistant U.S. attorney who once prosecuted Thornton, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-09-12-mn-21488-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>told </u><u>The Los Angeles Times</u></a> in 1985. “I hope he got a hell of a high out of that [cocaine].”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e17dn9hs1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/7b0fd6ec-180e-4db7-98aa-b972ecefdf97_1675802159.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Colin McEvoy" title="Headshot of Colin McEvoy" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Colin McEvoy joined the Biography.com staff in 2023, and before that had spent 16 years as a journalist, writer, and communications professional.
