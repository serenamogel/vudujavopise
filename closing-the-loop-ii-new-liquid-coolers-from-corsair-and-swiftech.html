<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>New Liquid Coolers from Corsair and Swiftech</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Introducing the Second Wave of Closed Loop Coolers</strong></p><p>When we visited CES 2013, it became increasingly clear that not only were closed loop liquid coolers here to stay, but that they are in fact "the next big thing" in desktop system cooling. There are good reasons to go for them, too. While you may have to deal with some mild pump noise depending on which model you go with, closed loop coolers are capable of providing excellent performance without creating a racket or placing too much stress on the motherboard (the way a heavy air cooler might).</p><p>That we have three new closed loop coolers available for review not long after the last roundup should tell you that the closed loop cooler market is, if you'll forgive the expression, heating up. On the heels of NZXT's Kraken X40 and X60, Corsair has their own H90 and H110 coolers based on the same Asetek 140mm and 280mm radiators. Our newer, potentially even more exciting competitor comes from Swiftech in the form of the 240mm H220. Unlike conventional closed loop coolers, Swiftech's entry uses high quality brass tubing and copper fins in the radiator along with their own specially designed pump and extra thick (yet still flexible hoses). Is it enough to shore up the difference between traditional 240mm radiators and monstrous 280mm ones?</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6716/Small%20(4%20of%206).jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We had seven coolers in our <a href=#>last roundup</a>, and today we're expanding that to ten. The introduction to the previous roundup is worth reading, but in a nutshell, the appeal of a closed loop cooler is the potential for quieter operation and less stress on the motherboard. There's also the fact that an air cooler has a harder (if not downright impossible) time matching the potential surface area (and thus cooling area) of larger radiators.</p><p>The majority of closed loop coolers start their lives as CoolIT or Asetek products, but Swiftech has thrown a wrench into that system in producing their own radiator, their own pump...pretty much everything but the backplate. The two new additions from Corsair, the H90 and H110, are both essentially the same Asetek radiators that NZXT is using for the Kraken line, but theoretically benefit from Corsair's fans. For a refresher, these are the specs of the previous seven coolers tested.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Corsair H80 (2012)</strong></td><td><strong>Corsair H55</strong></td><td><strong>Corsair H60 (2013)</strong></td><td><strong>Corsair H80i</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>120mm</td><td>120mm</td><td>120mm</td><td>120mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimensions (in mm)</strong></td><td>120x152x38</td><td>120x152x27</td><td>120x152x27</td><td>120x152x38</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fans (Supported)</strong></td><td>2 (2)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>2 (2)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OEM</strong></td><td>CoolIT</td><td>Asetek</td><td>CoolIT</td><td>CoolIT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MSRP (NewEgg)</strong></td><td>- (<a href=#>$109</a>)</td><td>$69 (<a href=#>$69</a>)</td><td>$79 (<a href=#>$74</a>)</td><td>$109 (<a href=#>$94</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Corsair H100i</strong></td><td><strong>NZXT Kraken X40</strong></td><td><strong>NZXT Kraken X60</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>240mm</td><td>140mm</td><td>280mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimensions (in mm)</strong></td><td>120x275x27</td><td>138.4x172.5x27</td><td>138.4x312.5x27</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fans (Supported)</strong></td><td>2 (4)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>2 (4)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OEM</strong></td><td>CoolIT</td><td>Asetek</td><td>Asetek</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MSRP (NewEgg)</strong></td><td>$119 (<a href=#>$109</a>)</td><td>$99 (<a href=#>$99</a>)</td><td>$139 (<a href=#>$136</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>And included below are the new three.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Swiftech H220</strong></td><td><strong>Corsair H90</strong></td><td><strong>Corsair H110</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td>240mm</td><td>140mm</td><td>280mm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimensions (in mm)</strong></td><td>127x269x29</td><td>140x170x27</td><td>140x312x29</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fans (Supported)</strong></td><td>2 (4)</td><td>1 (2)</td><td>2 (4)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OEM</strong></td><td>N/A</td><td>Asetek</td><td>Asetek</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MSRP (NewEgg)</strong></td><td>$139 (-)</td><td>$99 (-)</td><td>$129 (-)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The dimensions offered by NZXT and Corsair for the H90/X40 and H110/X60 are slightly different, but basically within the fudge factor margin of error. Given that these are extremely similar products, Corsair's relying primarily on their fans to differentiate from NZXT, although the H110 does come in for a healthy $10 cheaper than the X60.</p><p>What you may also be noticing is the lack of an "i" suffix on the new Corsair units, and unfortunately as you'll see later on, that's not a typographical or branding error so much as evidence of a very disappointing omission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN4fZVomqWno567qHnToZxmpJ%2BkvW61yGalnq9dobaywcidZJynn6Gys7%2BMn6mopV2YvLO%2FwKKpZpmemXq0w8ifq56bmA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bathurst-1000-race-car-driver-kenny-habul-revealed-as-buyer-of-mount-panorama-home.html><span>←</span><span>Aussie race car driver buys Bathurst home</span></a>
