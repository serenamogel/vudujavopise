They’re one of my favorite back-pocket meals, something I can whip up using basic ingredients when I need a simple dinner or work-from-home lunch. I’ve made a lot of them over the years, and I’ve learned some handy tips and tricks for making them along the way. I’m sharing them all in this quesadilla recipe! What is a quesadilla? A quesadilla is Mexican dish that consists of a heated, filled, and folded tortilla. Quesadillas originated in central and southern Mexico, and they were first made with corn tortillas and filled with Oaxaca cheese. (The…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This bean dip recipe is the ultimate party appetizer! It’s creamy, it’s cheesy, and it’s perfect for scooping up with tortilla chips. Just make sure to hit up the snack table right after it comes out of the oven. This bean dip disappears QUICK! And I haven’t told you the best part yet: this bean dip recipe is easy to make.&nbsp;It calls for refried beans (you can use canned or homemade), so instead of blending the dip in a food processor, you can simply stir it together in a bowl. Spread it in a baking dish, sprinkle it with cheese,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Super Bowl snacks are the best part of any Super Bowl party!&nbsp;Ok, for some people, the football is a highlight too, but I think we can all agree that the snacks are still important. To help you celebrate this year’s big game, I’ve rounded up my best Super Bowl food ideas below. They include everything you need to put together an epic game day spread—finger foods, delicious dips, salty snacks, desserts, and more. These Super Bowl recipes are easy, flavorful, and—most importantly—fun. Whether you’re tuning in for the halftime show, the commercials, or the game itself, they’ll make your Super…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This focaccia recipe is our favorite bread to bake at home. We love it because it’s soft and pillowy in the middle, crisp and golden around the edges, and filled with rich flavor from olive oil and sea salt. And that’s just the start! The #1 reason we love this focaccia recipe is that it’s so easy to make.&nbsp; When Jack first started baking bread (15+ years ago now!), he made lots of rustic ciabatta loaves. The ingredients were simple, and the bread came out delicious, but it required hours of rising and precise kneading. So when we discovered how…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In my totally unbiased opinion, we have some really great holiday appetizers on the blog (French onion dip or baked brie, anyone?), but this stuffed mushrooms recipe might just be my favorite. It’s Jack’s favorite too. Of course, he loves anything with mushrooms, but we’ve actually gotten into arguments about these stuffed mushrooms. I take them out of the oven, he samples a few, and before I know it, most of the batch is gone. I’ve learned the hard way: if I want any of these stuffed mushrooms for myself, I have to claim them ASAP. …which is to say…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>You don’t have to be vegan to love this vegan spinach artichoke dip. Just ask Jack. Whenever I make it, he can’t resist going back for seconds…and then thirds… This vegan spinach artichoke dip is creamy, tangy, and delicious. Who could say no to that? Instead of the traditional mayo and/or sour cream, blended cashews make up the creamy base of this plant-based dip. Nutritional yeast and onion powder add savory, cheesy flavor, while lemon juice and Dijon mustard give it the perfect bright kick. If you’re looking for a crowd-pleasing party appetizer or game day snack, make this vegan…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Candied pecans are a wonderful topping for salads, side dishes, and desserts…but in our house, they rarely make it that far. These sweet, crunchy, cinnamon-spiced nuts are SO tasty that Jack, the kiddo, and I usually polish them off as a snack. It’s very easy to think you’re going to have just one, maybe&nbsp;two, and then eat half a batch. Don’t say I didn’t warn you! Luckily, if you accidentally eat all the nuts you were supposed to put on a salad, it’s quick and easy to make more. This candied pecans recipe calls for 5 ingredients and comes together…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you don’t already have a go-to guacamole recipe, let me introduce you to mine. This guacamole recipe is easy to make. You can whip it up in 10 minutes or less! It calls for simple, fresh ingredients. Think ripe avocados, onion, cilantro, and lime. It’s DELICIOUS. This homemade guacamole is creamy, zesty, and bright. I developed the recipe while I was living in Austin, Texas. The city has incredible Tex Mex and Mexican food, and I ate a TON of great guac at local restaurants there. It inspired me to learn how to make guacamole at home.

It’s crispy on the outside, tender in the middle, and seasoned to perfection with a blend of savory spices. I love regular roasted cauliflower, but I have to admit—this air fryer cauliflower recipe is on another level. What makes it so delicious? Before I cook the cauliflower florets, I dredge them in a quick panko coating. It crisps up beautifully in the air fryer, giving the cauliflower an irresistible crunchy texture. I love this cauliflower on its own as a side dish or snack, but…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Soup season is here! There’s a lot to love about fall – beautiful weather, changing leaves, cozy baked goods, and hot drinks – but the soup recipes are hands down my favorite part. I adore soup. I love making it, I love eating it, and I love packing up the leftovers so that I can enjoy it again the next day. When I’m stressed, I turn to soup because I find it meditative to cook. When I’m snowed in, I turn to it because I keep a stash stored away in my freezer. And when I’m in need of a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Why aren’t we all making grilled carrots more often? That’s what I asked myself after I tried this grilled carrots recipe for the first time. Because friends, it is&nbsp;delicious.&nbsp; Carrots have a wonderful natural sweetness, which intensifies when you cook them on the grill. At the same time, they caramelize and char, creating a mouthwatering mix of sweet and smoky flavors. And texturally, they come out perfectly tender all the way through. Sorry, grilled asparagus and grilled eggplant—I’m making these grilled carrots for my next cookout.
