You could (and should) get creative with what you put in your air fryer. You could make <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-smores/>s’mores</a> at home, a rockin’ chicken parm, or a whole baked potato. There’s unfortunately nothing enticing about telling you to grab a russet potato from the produce section. I love looking around and seeing what products were created for everyone’s new favorite countertop appliance, and that naturally leads to a lot of frozen foods. It just so happens that I’m in the kingdom of fun frozen foods today, Trader Joe’s, so I’m leaning into it—sue me! These are the best air fryer foods I spotted on a recent visit to Trader Joe’s.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/the-best-trader-joes-groceries/>best Trader Joe’s products</a> we’ve ever tasted</strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Breaded Mozzarella Cheese Sticks</strong></a><p>If you bought an air fryer and the first thing you made it in it wasn’t mozzarella sticks, we can’t be friends. If I had my way, you’d be thrown in jail. Avoid that fate and have an out-of-body experience with a bag of TJ’s mozzarella sticks. There are no air fryer instructions on this bag—looks like TJ is getting some jail time, too—so I go with 400 degrees for six minutes.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-frozen-mozzarella-sticks/>best frozen mozzarella sticks</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Jalapeño & Cream Cheese Crispy Wontons</strong></a><p>Did someone say CRISPY? You know I can’t resist that word. The box promises a cheesy, spicy filling all wrapped in a crispy wonton that I just know will be mouthwatering after we cook it up in our air fryer. Sign me up! The only downside to these is that there are only 12 wontons. One weed gummy and you can kiss the whole box goodbye.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Perfectly Picked Pups</strong></a><p>If a mere 12 pieces in a box was alarming, nine is downright unthinkable. I can’t imagine a world in which I would only want nine of these little guys. At least give us an even ten, Trader Joe’s. Portion aside, these are gonna be real good out of the air fryer, kind of like an elevated mini corn dog with a briny kick. Prep these for an easy dinner as you watch the latest episode of Survivor or serve them as apps at your next <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-game-day-snacks/>game day watch party</a>!</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-trader-joes-frozen-appetizers/>best Trader Joe’s appetizers in the frozen section</a></strong></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Jamaican Style Beef Patties</strong></a><p>I can get down with a snack that becomes a meal if you eat enough of it, and these Jamaican beef patties are exactly what I’m talking about. One could be an afternoon snack that keeps you going until your dinner date, or you can cook up both patties for dinner when you’re too busy to make something from scratch; the best air fryer foods are versatile like that. Either way, these are going to be golden and crispy in the air fryer—and they’ll cool faster than they would in the oven, too.</p><a href=#><strong>Trader Joe’s Chicken Karaage</strong></a><p>Trader Joe’s chicken karaage first came onto my radar when Sporked‘s Gwynedd Stuart<a href=#> reviewed it</a> last year. In her words, “The breading is a little zesty, almost citrusy, and the chicken—which is marinated in mirin, <a href=#>soy sauce</a>, and garlic and ginger powders—is super flavorful.” In my words, it’s damn good. And you can make it in the air fryer! We are truly winning today.</p><a href=#><strong>Trader Joe’s Seasoned Corn Ribs</strong></a><p>I found another <a href=#>Sporked-reviewed product</a> that’s still in the frozen section of my local Trader Joe’s. The crew was a little iffy on these once-viral corn ribs, but hey, we desperately need some vegetables on this list, so let’s grab ‘em!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Kung Pao Tempura Cauliflower</strong></a><p>Hey look! Another vegetable! Yes, this cauliflower comes battered and fried, but it’s a vegetable all the same. This is certainly a fun way to get vegetables into the mix, at least. Throw this into your air fryer if you’re looking for a meat-free substitute to the karaage or something to pair with the crispy wontons.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trader Joe’s Portuguese Custard Tarts</strong></a><p>My air fryer is comically small, which is why I love these tarts for dessert. They’re small enough to fit into the basket but bring bold flavor to maximize a petite footprint. Air frying them gives you a classically creamy center with a flaky crust that you’ll be thinking about for weeks to come. This is a must-grab item for anyone looking for the best air fryer foods for dessert.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFurcirZJ%2BqqZq%2FbrLOqJusZZGperW%2BwJ2cq2WapLK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-sidewalk-rule-on-tiktok-relationship-urban-dictionary.html><span>←</span><span>What Is 'The Sidewalk Rule' On TikTok?
