One of the most interesting dynamics to be included in Netflix’s Wednesday is the mother-daughter relationship between Wednesday Addams and Morticia Addams. In other shows and movies surrounding the Addams family, there doesn’t seem to be as much drama and unhappiness between Wednesday and Morticia.

“Late Spring” tells a story that becomes sadder the more you think about it. There is a tension in the film between Noriko’s smile and her feelings. Her smile is often a mask. She smiles brightly during a strange early scene where she talks with a family friend, Onodera, who has remarried after the death of his wife. Such a second marriage is “filthy and foul,” she says, and it disgusts her.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lita: Im At Peace If Becky Lynch Match Was My Last, But Im Training In Case WWE Calls Me Again</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>
