With Bang’s retirement from the Hero Association, Atomic Samurai seeks a new formidable rival, and King catches his attention. The disciples hear the “King Engine” start, a sign of his nervousness transforming into readiness for a fight. King’s power is often associated with Saitama’s recorded feats against monsters, especially his Ultimate Purgatory Hellfire Burst in Chapter 154, which was actually done by Garou.</p><p>Atomic Samurai decides to challenge King, leading to a showdown outside. The confrontation escalates when Atomic Samurai throws an apple towards King, urging him to approach like a monster. However, King is overwhelmed by doubts and feels pressured to reveal his true self. He struggles with the situation, even asking for help, and Iaian notes the apparent openings in King’s defense, reminiscent of how Garou initially perceived him.</p><p>King attempts to use Talk No Jutsu to escape, but his insincerity is evident. The chapter ends with an epic display of emotions and anticipation, leaving fans excited to see how this encounter will unfold.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ez-clearholder-banner-1></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 banner-1 banner-1360 adtester-container adtester-container-360" data-ez-name=sportslumo_com-banner-1><span class=ezoic-ad-disclosure>Advertisements</span><span id=div-gpt-ad-sportslumo_com-banner-1-0 ezaw=300 ezah=250 class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>Read More:&nbsp;Every Anime Series Releasing in August 2023</p><p>One Piece Chapter 1088 Release Date, Spoilers, Recap and Where to Read</p><p>Chainsaw Man Manga Chapter 138 Release date, Recap, and Where to Read</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnn6OybrzUp5qhZZ2Wu265wKeemmWTna6xwMSrZGpxYGK%2FprjEmqqeZZSWwaZ50qmmoqSVp8BuvsScmKllkaOxbsPHnqmeZaSkerOxwJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-champion-siblings-does-he-have-a-sister-family-and-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Jack Champion Siblings: Does He Have A Sister?
