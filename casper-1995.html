<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Casper movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1995)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There's been a lot of speculation about the coming age of computerized performances in the movies, when we will see whole characters made up of bits and bytes. Jessica Rabbit was such a creation, and now Casper and his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso - dominate a movie that essentially stars computer programming.</p><p>Ghosts offer, to be sure, certain advantages to the programmers, since their bodies are soft and changeable, but their faces display a full range of emotion, and they are as real as the human characters in the film - which is, I suppose, a two-edged compliment.</p><p>As the movie opens, a rich man's daughter named Carrigan (<a href=#>Cathy Moriarty</a>) learns that her father has left her nothing in his will, except for crumbling Whipstaff Manor in Maine. She's enraged, until her assistant, Dibs (<a href=#>Eric Idle</a>), discovers a secret message suggesting that a vast treasure may be hidden there. They leave immediately for Maine - where, of course, it turns out that Whipstaff Manor is haunted.</p><p>She determines to get rid of the ghosts, and the movie has a lot of fun with scenes involving an exorcist (<a href=#>Don Novello</a> as Father Guido Sarducci) and a ghostbuster (<a href=#>Dan Aykroyd</a>). Nothing works. Meanwhile, Casper, the resident ghost, pulls himself away from watching "Mr.&nbsp;Rogers' Neighborhood" long enough to learn, on the news, about a ghost psychiatrist who specializes in helping spirits come to peace with themselves, so they won't need to haunt any longer.</p><p>Casper draws the program to Carrigan's attention in an insistent if ghostly way, and soon the psychiatrist (<a href=#>Bill Pullman</a>, from "<a href=#>While You Were Sleeping</a>") is on the case, along with his daughter Kat (<a href=#>Christina Ricci</a>, from "<a href=#>The Addams Family</a>"). Kat and Casper soon become fast friends, and Casper is telling her what it's like to be a ghost: "You know that tingling feeling when your foot falls asleep? I think I'm made of that." Unfortunately, the presence of flesh and blood in Whipstaff Manor draws Casper's uncles from an ectoplasm, and things get exciting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cmKyolad6coWYbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-barry-brewer-wife-jasmine-brewer-meet-her-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Barry Brewer Wife Jasmine Brewer?
