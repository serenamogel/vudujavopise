But what do the best frozen dumplings all have in common? Well, whether you’re looking for the best frozen soup dumplings, the best frozen potstickers, or the best frozen gyoza, they should be juicy, savory, and bursting with flavor. Their wrappers should be delicate yet sturdy, yielding a soft, doughy pull even after they crisp up in the pan. Inside, the minced meat should taste succulent and enticing or, if you’re opting for veggie gyoza, include vibrant, evenly cooked vegetables that don’t turn to mush after you steam them.&nbsp;</p><p>The science is clear: People love dumplings. <a href=#>Soup dumplings</a>, potstickers, wontons, gyoza … no matter the type, these savory pillows have earned international fame and appeal as one of the best comfort foods known to man. In fact, they’re growing more <a href=# rel=noopener>popular every year</a>, thanks to the rise in authentic Asian and Asian-fusion restaurants across the globe. And rightfully so. We can’t think of a food that delivers more instant serotonin than a juicy, delicious dumpling, can you?&nbsp;</p><p>As we sat down for our second taste test of the best frozen dumplings, we were eager to try more niche and unique products we overlooked last time. But more importantly, for your benefit, we were looking for the top contenders in each genre of dumpling. Some of those dumpling genres include: the best pork dumplings for that classic, East Asian-inspired taste; the best frozen soup dumplings to bring restaurant-quality xiao long bao into your home; and the best vegan dumplings for our plant-based pals and gals. No matter what kind of dumpling you’re dreaming about, hopefully this ranking points you in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-DUMPLING_INSET-05.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Creative</p><strong><strong>Nasoya Organic Korean BBQ Vegetable Dumplings</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Originally based out of Massachusetts, Nasoya is a vegan tofu brand that has their own line of vegan dumplings we were excited to try for the first time. Now, I’ll be honest: These may not be the best frozen veggie dumplings for everyone. Our editor-and-chief <a href=#>Justine Sterling</a> called them “hippie vegan dumplings” when she tried them, and I completely agree. They taste more like a Korean-inspired ravioli than a traditional East Asian <a href=#>gyoza or potsticker</a>. The filling is a nice blend of sweet soy and savory beef flavor, but its soft, crumbly texture might also remind you of, well, cheese. The dumpling wrapper is thick, pasta-like, and even looks like a traditional ravioli. Nasoya also has a <a href=# rel=noopener>Thai Basil Vegetable</a> flavor that’s very yummy—we just favored the complexity of the Korean BBQ and were extra shocked to know they were 100% vegan. Nasoya isn’t our #1 pick for the best vegan dumplings brand, but they absolutely deserve a place in our ranking of the best frozen dumplings for their creativity and ingenuity.&nbsp; —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/thai-shrimp-gyoza.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Seafood Dumplings</p><strong>Trader Joe’s Thai Shrimp Gyoza</strong><p>I don’t know how, I don’t know why, but Trader Joe’s has figured out how to make some of the best frozen gyoza on the market, and their thai shrimp gyoza are no exception. These taste straight out of a dim sum restaurant. The shrimp in the filling is plump and juicy. They’re chive-forward, which I love in a seafood dumpling. The wrapper is a little pre-browned before you even cook them, which guarantees a nice and crispy bottom. Who doesn’t love a nice and crispy bottom? These are still the best frozen shrimp dumplings you can find at a major grocery store, hands down. —Jordan Myrick</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/wontons.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Wontons</strong></p><strong><strong>Trader Joe’s Chicken Cilantro Mini Wontons</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Trader Joe’s</a><p>Not that a dumpling needs to be cute, but it’s worth noting that Trader Joe’s Chicken Cilantro Mini Wontons are very, very cute and tiny. But don’t let their size fool you—they pack tons of meaty flavor with notes of cilantro and ginger. These are the best frozen dumplings to toss these into some premade broth or miso soup for a quick and easy wonton soup dinner. You can even add veggies and noodles to make chicken wonton ramen. These are super cheap so you’ll save money by not going to a pricey ramen restaurant. Save restaurant ramen for special occasions and turn to these for your weeknight fix. &nbsp;—Jordan Myrick</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Trader Joe’s</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-DUMPLING_INSET-01.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Gingery</p><strong><strong>Laoban Ginger Chicken Dumplings</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>The Laoban brand is inspired by a traditional Chinese dumpling shop located in Washington, DC. I have to admit, I was skeptical of them at first. The packaging is adorably minimalistic, if not a little too trendy for my tastes. When I scattered the dumplings out of the bag, my immediate thought was, “Welp, this is a rip-off.” For a $7 price point, the serving size looked like one or two meals, tops. They also don’t look very appealing; the wrapper appeared too thick, and the frozen dumplings held limply together. But that’s the thing about first impressions, guys. They usually suck. I took one bite, and suddenly I was covering my mouth like a scandalized Victorian maiden. Laoban’s ingredients taste so fresh. The wrapper is on the chewier side, but it actually has a soft, handmade appeal that still crisps up nicely in a pan (for our second taste test, I pan fried all of the dumplings for the sake of ease and because I like my dumplings on the crisp side). The filling is so juicy, the chicken tastes like real chicken, and the light touch of ginger makes every bite unique. These are some of the best frozen dumplings, even if I get less bang for my buck. —Ariana Losch&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-DUMPLING_INSET-07.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Vegan Dumplings</p><strong><strong>Omni Plant-Based Pork Style Potstickers</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>In our search for the best vegan dumplings, we tried several brands side-by-side, and on looks alone, I was convinced these would be the worst. Other vegan brands went for the classic pinched potsticker appearance, but these, like Laoban, look like they’d just been hastily folded in the kitchen and thrown in a bag. These also took the longest to crisp up in the pan, so needless to say I was concerned they would be too doughy. But nope! Don’t judge a dumpling by its wrapper, apparently. These potstickers are actually quite light, with a nice ginger tang and crunchy cabbage texture. The fake-meat taste, unlike other brands, is virtually nonexistent here. Admittedly, that’s partly because you can’t taste a super strong pork flavor. It’s more of a “vegetable (and pork) dumpling” than a “pork (and vegetable) dumpling,” if you get my drift. That said, the texture is not mushy, and out of all the vegan dumplings on my plate, I kept coming back to these. Definitely the best vegan dumplings you can find at major grocery stores. —Ariana Losch&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-DUMPLING_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Vegetable Dumplings</p><strong><strong>Laoban Livin’ on the Vedge Dumplings</strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I have a vendetta against mushy vegetable dumplings. It’s a pretty pointless and sad vendetta, to be honest with you, because even the best frozen veggie dumplings are going to be a little mushier inside than their savory counterparts. But these punny Laoban “Livin’ on the Vedge” dumplings are easily the best vegetable dumplings I’ve had to date. Are they mushy? A little bit, yes—but definitely the least of all the other brands we tried. The filling’s thick, almost meaty slices of shitake mushroom, crunchy bok choy, and spicy Chinese chili crisps all work in tandem to create a bold flavor explosion. Seriously, I didn’t think veggie dumplings could taste this savory and complex. I’d eat these over just about any chicken or pork dumpling any day of the week. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/RANKING-UPDATE_FROZEN-DUMPLING_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Grocery Store Brand</p><strong><strong><strong>Signature Selects Potstickers, Chicken & Vegetable</strong></strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Signature Selects Chicken & Veggie Potstickers (the house brand at Albertsons-owned grocery stores) are, simply put, impossible to fault. The dark chicken meat seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger blends perfectly with crunchy cabbage and green onions. Even after you crisp them, the dumpling wrappers have a nice doughy pull. Their family-sized bags are big and budget-friendly, making these some of the best frozen potstickers you can find at a major food retailer. We liked them better than countless other brands of chicken gyoza, including (gasp) Trader Joe’s. Still, there was one other brand we liked more than Signature Select. —Ariana Losch&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tai-pei-chicken-gyoza-1.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Chicken Dumplings</p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Tai Pei Chicken Potstickers</strong></strong></strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>These blew the other chicken dumplings out of the water, mostly because they taste like they were made with flavorful dark meat chicken. If a chicken leg dumpling doesn’t sound delicious to you, keep scrolling. But if you’re smart, you think chicken leg dumplings sound incredible and you will be buying these Tai Pei Chicken Potstickers. They’re peppery, savory, and brown nicely when you cook them. These are some of the best frozen dumplings if you’re cutting down on red meat or if you’re a chicken lover in general. —Jordan Myrick</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best soup dumplings" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_SOUP_DUMPLINGS_INSET_01_updated.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Soup Dumplings</p><strong><strong><strong>Bibigo Chicken Soup Dumplings & Bibigo Pork Soup Dumplings</strong></strong></strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Kroger</a><p>Bibigo is the king of soup dumplings. The fact that they make some of the best frozen soup dumplings on an international scale should simply not be contested. You get plenty of rich broth when you bite into these. To sweeten the pot even more, these are microwaveable and come with their own dipping sauce! Not that you need another reason to buy these, but I found both the chicken and the pork versions at my local Dollar Tree for an extremely low price.

Flavor-wise, Laoban’s Pork & Chive dumplings can’t be beat. I stand by that, even though they only earned second place in this ranking. They are boldly savory and so succulent and juicy, you actually have to be careful biting into them. But we have to consider the full package, and frankly, the full package is a little pricey compared to other brands. Laoban may make some of the best frozen dumplings we’ve tried to date, but they also look and taste different than the gyoza you expect to receive at a restaurant—and many of us are searching for that distinct appeal.Still, the creativity and overall wow factor deserves high praise. —Ariana Losch</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TJ-pork-dumplings.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Trader Joe’s Pork Gyoza Potstickers</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><p>Remember what I said about their Thai shrimp dumplings? Trader Joe’s has the gyoza game on lock. It’s puzzling, considering there are plenty of Asian cuisine brands out vying for this top spot, but alas. TJ’s pork gyoza check all the right boxes and still come at an incredibly affordable price. They are so juicy, flavorful, and meaty. They’re gingery and, while super savory, have a hint of sweetness that is really pleasant. After we cooked them, they looked like gyoza you’d get from a restaurant. I would eat an entire bag of these with some black vinegar on any given Friday night and feel extremely happy about it. —Jordan Myrick</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Trader Joe’s</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other Products We Tried:</strong> Trader Joe’s Thai Vegetable Gyoza, PF Chang’s Pork Dumplings, PF Changs Chicken Dumplings, Feel Good Veggie Dumplings, Tai Pei Pork Dumplings, Ling Ling Chicken and Vegetable Dumplings, Trader Joe’s Chicken Potstickers, Fusia Pork Potstickers, Fusia Chicken Potstickers, Crazy Cuizine Asian Style Gyoza Dumpling, Crazy Cuizine Pork Potstickers Asian Style Gyoza Dumpling, Feel Good Foods Potstickers Chicken Gluten Free, Feel Good Foods Vegetable Dumplings, Feel Good Foods Dumplings Pork, Sprouts Chicken Gyoza Potstickers, Sprouts Pork Gyoza Potstickers, Nasoya Dumplings Vegan Tofu Vegetable, Hungry Planet Pork Gyoza, O’Food Plant-Based Mandu KBBQ Flavor (Korean-style Potstickers)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFustGosZ6mXZnCrrzLoqWgq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yara-shahidi-black-tinker-bell-really-powerful-7486425.html><span>←</span><span>Yara Shahidi Says Playing Tinker Bell Was &amp;quot;Really Powerful&amp;quot;</span></a>
