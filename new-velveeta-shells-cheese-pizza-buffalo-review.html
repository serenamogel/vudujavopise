<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Velveeta Shells &amp;amp; Cheese Comes in 2 New Flavorsand We Tried Them</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Velveeta Shells & Cheese is a classic comfort food (and one of the <a href=#>best boxed mac and cheese brands</a>), and one of its virtues is its pleasant blandness. It’s creamy and it’s salty, and that’s pretty much all it needs to be to satisfy the masses. That said, I suspect a lot of people DIY their Velveeta Shells & Cheese, spicing it up with things like <a href=#>taco seasoning</a>, <a href=#>hot sauce</a>, and <a href=#>ranch dressing</a>. If you’re one of those people, Velveeta made something you’re going to like: new Velveeta Buffalo mac and cheese and Velveeta pizza mac and cheese. To be perfectly honest, I wasn’t holding out much hope that these new offerings would taste good to anyone over the age of 12, but I was wrong. I enlisted our lovely intern, Madison Ramirez, to cook up these two new Velveeta flaves and my adult palate was pretty damn pleased.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

This boxed mac and cheese kind of nails it, in a perfectly artificial way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you were concerned (I was) that this mac and cheese would punch you in the face with pizza flavor like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on speed, I’m pleased to report that the pizza flavor in the cheese sauce is pretty mild—and I think that’s a good thing. There’s a dash of oregano and just a little bit of tomatoey tang to complement the creaminess of the delicious (if plasticky) Velveeta cheese. The subtlety of the flavor kept me coming back for bite after bite.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> If you really wanted to be punched in the face by a Ninja Turtle, you’re probably going to be disappointed.</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#dd7d42></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="velveeta shells & cheese buffalo" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NPR_VELVEETA-MAC-AND-CHEESE-PIZZA-AND-BUFFALO_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New Product!</p><strong>Velveeta Buffalo Shells & Cheese</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>I expected this Velveeta Buffalo mac and cheese to taste like Velveeta Shells & Cheese with a big ol’ glug of <a href=#>Buffalo sauce</a> in the mix. That’s not what you get—but that’s okay.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Rather than leaning hard into the vinegary twang of Buffalo sauce, Velveeta Buffalo mac and cheese is all about the buttery, garlicky aspects of Buffalo wings. It smells like butter and garlic, and the flavor finishes with a buttery roundness and some genuine heat. Honestly, if the cheese sauce wasn’t aggressively orange, I might not even place that it was meant to be Buffalo flavored. I can’t believe I’m typing this, but it’s a more sophisticated take on Buffalo than I would have expected from Velveeta.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>If you want big, tangy Buffalo sauce flavor, you won’t love this. But in that case…just add some Buffalo sauce to your shells and cheese, right?</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKaVrHq3scuvnJ6skWLAqbHLpapmm5iasrSxjKmgs7KRYq%2B2ssWao6hloprDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jimmy-choo-2.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Jimmy Choo Personal Life: His Marriage and Awards</span></a>
