Breathtaking, erotic, grotesque, and transgressive, the film mixes watercolors influenced by Western art—Klimt is in here, but so are Degas and Kandinsky—with imagery ripped straight from a nightmare.

The film screened briefly in 2009, but now it's getting its first American theatrical release in a 4K digital restoration—which means its visuals are all the more vivid, accompanied by a very 1970s score by the avant-garde jazz composer Masahiko Satoh.</description></item><item><title>Latest Disney News: Haunted Mansion is 3 Disney obsessions gone rogue as the Mouse House mocks</title><link>/latest-disney-news-haunted-mansion-confirms-that-disney-is-playing-hide-and-seek-at-the-box-office-as-the-mouse-house-mocks-its-28b-wings.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/latest-disney-news-haunted-mansion-confirms-that-disney-is-playing-hide-and-seek-at-the-box-office-as-the-mouse-house-mocks-its-28b-wings.html</guid><description>Disney is having a moment — with chaos on one end, carelessness on the other, and its truest villain stirring up nostalgia in the middle.

Flickering typically indicates that the automobile is unable to provide sufficient power to the ballast. Connecting the HID system directly to the vehicle battery will allow you to quickly and easily verify this.

Intel wanted us to have a reference point for a good Arrandale setup for the arrival of Sandy Bridge, and that meant sticking with the Intel IGP and CPU.
