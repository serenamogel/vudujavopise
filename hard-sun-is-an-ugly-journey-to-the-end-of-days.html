A woman played by Deyn is viciously beaten in a fight in her own kitchen by what looks like a sociopathic lunatic. He punches and kicks her, pouring gasoline on her body before he turns on the gas and, in slo-mo, lights the place on fire. She stumbles out just before it explodes … roll credits! It’s a slimy, icky way to start a show and I’m not sure creator <a href=#>Neil Cross</a>, who has mined the dark side of humanity well in his award-winning “<a href=#>Luther</a>,” ever recovers from the tone it sets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5a999a7b297ed3705a00010d/content_Hard_Sun_2.jpg><p>Did I mention that the attacker in the opening scene is the woman’s son? Of course, he’s a bit mentally unstable, but she survives the assault. We learn that she’s a DI Officer named Elaine Renko, and she’s now partnered with DCI Officer Charlie Hicks, played by Sturgess. Of course, he’s a Cop on the Edge, the kind of guy who doesn’t need or trust a new partner, but the two are forced to work together on the investigation of a suspicious suicide—which we see in graphic detail, including a body hurling through the air and splattering on a kid’s backpack. Oh, and, of course, Renko is working behind the scenes to try and prove that Hicks is corrupt.</p><p>The investigation of the suicide leads to the real high concept of “Hard Sun.” Believe it or not, this show was inspired by <a href=#>David Bowie</a>’s banger “Five Years,” which imagines a world united when it finds out it only has a half-decade left. The title refers to a report that the officers find that reveals an extinction level event is only five years away. What would a pre-apocalyptic world be like? How would it change human behavior? Criminal investigations? Of course, most people wouldn’t allow themselves to believe it—and the government would do a good job branding it #fakenews—but what would the people do who knew it was accurate?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqGZopl6tMHNZqCsZZGjerazy7Jko6elp7umxYytpmasmJp6prrDZqafZZSWxrQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mikki-gambler-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Mikki Gambler Net Worth 2024</span></a>
