Moore hit the jackpot with the 1990 hit Ghost, which, along with her marriage to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bruce-willis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bruce Willis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bruce Willis</a>, established her as a Hollywood A-lister for the next few years. Flops like Striptease and G.I. Jane marked the end of her run on top, though she continued to surface in films like Charlie's Angels 2, while publicly facing professional and personal obstacles.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore was born Demetria Guynes on November 11, 1962, in Roswell, New Mexico. Her parents split up before she was born, and she was raised by her mother and stepfather, Virginia and Danny Guynes, both of whom drank heavily.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore had moved more than 30 times by the time she turned 14, eventually settling in Los Angeles. Moore later explained in Interview magazine that "By moving around a lot, I learned to assimilate into whatever new surroundings I had and to become very comfortable with people quickly. I think that was one of the strongest contributing factors to my becoming an actor."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Soap Star and Early Roles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dropping out of high school at 16, Moore worked as a debt collector for a time and tried modeling. She also developed an interest in acting. In 1981, Moore landed a role on the popular television soap opera General Hospital. She played journalist Jackie Templeton for two years. That same year, Moore made her film debut in the independent drama Choices.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During her stint on General Hospital, Moore found time for a few film projects. Following her marriage to musician Freddie Moore in 1981, she appeared with him in the 3-D science fiction horror flick Parasite (1982). Moore also had a bit part in the soap opera spoof Young Doctors in Love (1982).</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'St. Elmo's Fire' Breakout</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After leaving her soap opera role, Moore struggled to build a career in film. She played Michael Caine's daughter in Blame it on Rio (1984), which attracted little attention from critics or movie-goers. Taking on a leading role, Moore played Jon Cryer's love interest in No Small Affair (1984), but she didn't capture the public's attention until her performance in St. Elmo's Fire (1985). This film told the story of a group of friends as they confront post-college life. The cast also included a number of other young stars on the rise, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/rob-lowe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rob Lowe" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rob Lowe</a>, Andrew McCarthy, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/judd-nelson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Judd Nelson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Judd Nelson</a>, Ally Sheedy and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/emilio-estevez data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emilio Estevez" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emilio Estevez</a>. Many of these performers were becoming equally famous for their off-screen antics and partying lifestyle, with the media dubbing them the "Brat Pack."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In her personal life, Moore divorced her first husband in 1984. She started dating Emilio Estevez, and the two became engaged in 1985. The couple starred together in 1986's Wisdom, which Estevez also wrote and directed. That same year, Moore starred opposite Rob Lowe in About Last Night, a look at young singles in Chicago. Critic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/roger-ebert data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roger Ebert" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roger Ebert</a> praised both of their performances, saying the film "gives them the best acting opportunities either one has ever had, and they make the most of them." He also singled out Moore as "especially impressive. There isn't a romantic note she isn't required to play in this movie, and she plays them all flawlessly."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage to Bruce Willis and 'Ghost' Stardom</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Again playing the love interest, Moore co-starred with John Cusack in the popular comedy One Crazy Summer (1986). She was working steadily, but had yet to score a major box office hit. In 1987, she and Estevez broke up, and Moore later met actor Bruce Willis, who was then on the popular television show Moonlighting, with Cybill Shepherd. The two began dating and were married in November 1987 in Las Vegas. In 1988 they welcomed their first child together, daughter Rumer, who was named after the British writer Rumer Godden.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Moore returned to the big screen with The Seventh Sign, an apocalyptic thriller. She played a pregnant woman trying to stop the end of the world. Despite a few positive reviews for her performance, the film only earned about $16 million at the box office. Moore took on lighter fare with her next effort, 1989's We're No Angels, which starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-de-niro data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert De Niro" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sean-penn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean Penn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean Penn</a>. Despite its impressive cast, the film did not fare well with audiences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore's biggest career breakthrough came in 1990 with the romantic drama Ghost. She played Molly, a young woman whose husband Sam (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/patrick-swayze data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Patrick Swayze" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Patrick Swayze</a>) was murdered. His spirit works with a psychic (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/whoopi-goldberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Whoopi Goldberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Whoopi Goldberg</a>) to avenge his death and to protect Molly from those involved. Showing impressive vulnerability on screen, Moore earned praise for her work on the film, which became a huge hit. Ghost brought in approximately $218 million at the box office and earned five Academy Award nominations.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'A Few Good Men' and 'Striptease'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore's next two films, Nothing But Trouble (1991) and The Butcher's Wife (1991), showed off her comedic side. They both, however, failed to attract much of an audience. That same year, Moore became the talk of the nation with her controversial Vanity Fair cover. She was in the midst of her second pregnancy when she posed in the nude for the magazine's cover. While surprised by the dramatic response to the image, Moore also saw the cover as a chance to challenge perceptions about women and pregnancy. "People in this country don't want to embrace motherhood and sensuality. ... You're either sexy, or you're a mother. I didn't want to have to choose," she told Interview magazine. Not too long after that issue appeared on newsstands, Moore and Willis celebrated the birth of their second daughter, Scout.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Co-starring with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/tom-cruise data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tom Cruise" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tom Cruise</a>, Moore played a tough Navy lawyer in the smash hit A Few Good Men (1992). She continued to prosper commercially with Indecent Proposal (1993), teaming with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/woody-harrelson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Woody Harrelson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Woody Harrelson</a> to play a married couple in financial trouble who travel to Las Vegas to gamble their way back to solvency. They end up losing their money and befriending a lonely billionaire (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/robert-redford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Redford" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Redford</a>), who offers the desperate couple $1 million for the opportunity to sleep with Moore's character. While reviews were mixed, the film brought in a respectable $104 million at the box office.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore had her third child with Willis in 1994, a daughter named Tallulah. That same year, she starred opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/michael-douglas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael Douglas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Michael Douglas</a> in the box office hit Disclosure. Moore played a top executive who sexually harasses Douglas's character. In an interview for Entertainment Weekly, she explained why she took the controversial role: "I'd never played a villain before so that was attractive to me," she said, adding that she was a "wreck" during filming: "I've never showed up for a show where I literally started shaking before every scene. I've never stepped into someone who's so cunning — she's just really scary."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1995, Moore made movie history when she became the highest paid actress at the time — netting a $12.5 million payday for Striptease (1996). The film is about a single mother who works as a stripper to earn money to fight her ex-husband for custody of their daughter (played by Moore's real-life daughter Rumer). The film proved to be a commercial and critical disappointment.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Professional and Personal Obstacles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore faced more personal challenges around this time. Her estranged mother was diagnosed with brain cancer in 1997, and the mother and daughter finally reunited. Moore stayed with her mother for the final months of her life. Virginia Guynes succumbed to her disease in July 1998. At the same time, Moore had to cope with another loss. She and Willis announced their separation after more than 10 years of marriage, just days before Guynes's passing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore also continued to struggle professionally. She starred in 1997's G.I. Jane as the first woman to attempt to join the elite Navy Seals military unit. For her role Moore trained vigorously, lifting weights for two hours a day and going for six-mile runs. She even shaved off her hair for one scene. All of this dedication, however, translated into a middling showing at the box office. Moore later said that the media reports "killed G.I. Jane before it ever even had a moment," according to Entertainment Weekly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, she did find success during this time through her production company, Moving Pictures. She signed on to produce the hit comedy Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) and its sequels, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002).</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Charlie's Angels' Comeback</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Retreating from the Hollywood scene in 1998, Moore and her three daughters moved to Hailey, Idaho, where she and Willis had previously purchased a home. During her time in Hailey, Moore mostly focused on raising her daughters. She left her quiet small-town life to act in one film: the independent drama Passion of Mind (2000).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore's next big screen venture was heralded as her comeback. In Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle (2003), she played a villain named Madison Lee. Moore appeared opposite such younger talents as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/drew-barrymore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Drew Barrymore" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Drew Barrymore</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lucy-liu data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lucy Liu" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lucy Liu</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/cameron-diaz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cameron Diaz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cameron Diaz</a>. "She's so lovely and so powerful. Here's a woman who has three children — she goes toe-to-toe with Cameron Diaz in a bikini. She's awesome. I just enjoy her performances and her gutsiness," said the film's director, McG.</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage to Ashton Kutcher</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, Moore was also attracting a lot of media attention for her off-screen life. She began dating 25-year-old actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ashton-kutcher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ashton Kutcher" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ashton Kutcher</a>, 15 years her junior. The tabloids could not seem to get enough of this May-December romance, with some speculating whether their relationship was merely a publicity stunt. Moore and Kutcher proved their critics wrong when they married in September 2005 at their Beverly Hills home. Kutcher became very close with Moore's daughters, who sometimes called him "MOD" — for "My Other Dad."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore went on to take a small but dramatic role playing an alcoholic lounge singer in Emilio Estevez's Bobby (2006), which imagined the final hours of Robert Kennedy through the eyes of different people at the Los Angeles Ambassador Hotel. Her strong performance earned a share of critical praise. Moore followed up this success with the thriller Mr. Brooks (2007), playing a detective pursuing a serial killer (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kevin-costner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Costner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin Costner</a>). She then co-starred in the heist caper Flawless (2008), with Michael Caine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore continued to tackle an interesting mix of projects. She had a role in the independent family drama Happy Tears, with Parker Posey, Rip Torn and Ellen Barkin, which screened at the Berlin Film Festival in February 2009. In the 2010 noir action film, Bunraku, Moore appeared with Josh Hartnett and Ron Perlman. She also co-starred with David Duchovny in the offbeat drama The Joneses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, Moore gave another impressive performance in the drama Margin Call, which starred Jeremy Irons, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kevin-spacey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kevin Spacey" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kevin Spacey</a> and Paul Bettany. She also expanded her work behind the camera that same year, signing a deal with the Lifetime cable network for several new projects.</p><h2 data-node-id=49 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Divorce and More Challenges</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In November 2011, Moore filed for divorce from husband Ashton Kutcher in the wake of numerous reports that he had been unfaithful to her. At the time, she released a statement, saying "As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life." Their divorce was finalized in 2013.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 2012, Moore seemed to experiencing a personal crisis. She was taken to a Los Angeles hospital early in the year after suffering a seizure from inhaling nitrous oxide, according to TMZ. Moore did not publicly acknowledge the incident, but she did decide to seek help for some health issues. A spokesperson for the actress said that Moore planned to get "professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and improve her overall health." She also dropped out of the film Lovelace, about the famed porn star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/linda-lovelace data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Linda Lovelace" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Linda Lovelace</a>. Moore had signed on to play feminist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/gloria-steinem data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gloria Steinem" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gloria Steinem</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=53 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">TV, More Films and Memoir</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Moore soon resumed working fairly steadily, albeit outside of the spotlight. She had prominent roles in Very Good Girls (2014), Forsaken (2015) and Wild Oats (2016), and starred as the female lead of Blind (2016), alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/alec-baldwin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alec Baldwin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alec Baldwin</a>.
