As for the Kyurem formes BST, no... 720 BST should go to the complete Original Dragon only. However, B/W Kyurem are actually stronger than Reshiram/Zekrom obviously and have so far been presented as such. A 700 BST makes the most sense to me.

Rotom, for example, gained 80 BST points by just possessing a household appliance (however, this drastic change could be explained due to its design basis and the appliance acting supportive, and maybe a couple of other things.). But that is just my opinion. Evidently the word "generate" and "herbivore" are too complex for our little minds, so they give us V-Create and Sap Sipper.<p>But <i>everyone</i> would get "Therian"!</p><p>Not saying using an obscure word is bad since it educates, but really, be consistent.</p>The Pokédex states that Victini is capable of creating energy, therefore "creation" and "generation" are used almost synonymous in the context.<p>Sap Sipper makes me think of Heracross. Makes still not much sense as ability name considering the Pokémon who get it.</p><p>Therian is fitting. Just calling them <i>Beast Formes</i>, for example would be plain boring. At least they are trying to improve, what is wrong with that?</p>@<a href=#>El_</a> It <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.livedoor.jp%2Fpokemon2ch%2Farchives%2F9578764.html&hash=2645d8b5024570c851d1f5f2be5bf0be" rel="nofollow noopener">seems</a> that your guess about the base stats is right. Bear in mind that this information is unconfirmed, though.<p>Trainers in Black City and White Forest use legendaries such as Entei and Latios (Alder's grandson uses the latter). Game Freak are going too far; this is the first time that legendaries are being used outside the Battle Tower/Frontier/Subway (barring N's dragon, which was relevant to the story).</p>Trainers in the Trainer Tower in Emerald also had legendary Pokémon in their Party, encountered under normal battle circumstances. Given that the area is apparently post-game, that is not such a drastic change.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMRmo56flaOxor7Inqpmp5Zir62twqRka2WRo7Fuw8eiq55lYmN%2BdHyVbmxoqJGcsm59jw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nittha-jirayungyurn.html><span>←</span><span>Nittha Jirayungyurn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
