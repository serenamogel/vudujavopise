Sweetos are cinnamon-sugar-flavored corn puffs. They were first released in February 2015 as an Easter-related treat and the Cheeto company’s first-ever sweet snack release. At the time, they were called “Sweetos Cinnamon Sugar Puffs,” and were very clearly an Easter food. Each puff was distinctly Easter egg-shaped."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

At the time, they were called “Sweetos Cinnamon Sugar Puffs,” and were very clearly an Easter food. Each puff was distinctly Easter egg-shaped. They had a brief wreath-shaped holiday run in late 2015, then they were back to being egg-shaped in the spring of 2016. In 2017, they were rebranded as “Sweetos Eggs” and the company also released a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">caramel version</a>. In 2019 they released a savory version of the egg-shaped puff in their classic cheese flavor, and by 2020 it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back to the classic cinnamon-sugar-flavored Sweetos Eggs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, their packaging on the Cheeto Instagram page seems to be a lot less Easter-themed than the original 2015 packaging, but don’t worry, the Sweetos are still egg-shaped as ever.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Chester Cheetah (@cheetos)</a></p></figure><p>Since their inception, Sweetos has been a cinnamon sugary Easter staple with a cult following. Was I around in 2015? You bet. Did I know Sweetos existed? I most certainly did not. And now that I do know they exist I feel like I have an obligation to try them, especially since I just spent an hour combing the internet for bits and pieces of that grand ol’ Sweeto history.&nbsp;</p><p>On an unrelated note, if Sweetos are just corn puffs covered in cinnamon sugar, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are they actually… a cereal</a>?
