On the day when I saw "Slackers," there were many things I expected and even wanted to see in a movie, but I confess Mamie Van Doren's breasts were not among them.</p><p>The movie is an exhausted retread of the old campus romance gag where the pretty girl almost believes the lies of the reprehensible schemer, instead of trusting the nice guy who loves her. The only originality the movie brings to this formula is to make it incomprehensible, through the lurching incompetence of its story structure. Details are labored while the big picture remains unpainted.</p><p>"Slackers" should not be confused with Richard Linklater's "<a href=#>Slacker</a>" (1991), a film that will be treasured long after this one has been turned into landfill. "Slackers" stars the previously blameless <a href=#>Devon Sawa</a> ("<a href=#>SLC Punk!</a>," "<a href=#>Final Destination</a>") and <a href=#>Jason Schwartzman</a> ("<a href=#>Rushmore</a>") as rivals for the attention of the beautiful Angela (<a href=#>James King</a>, who despite her name is definitely a girl). Schwartzman plays Ethan, campus geek; Sawa is Dave, a professional cheater and con man. Ethan obsesses over Angela and blackmails Sawa by threatening to expose his exam cheating scheme. He demands that Dave "deliver" the girl to him.</p><p>This demand cannot be met for a number of reasons. One of them is that Ethan is comprehensively creepy (he not only has an Angela doll made from strands of her hair, but does things with it I will not tire you by describing). Another reason is that Angela falls for Dave. The plot requires Angela to temporarily be blinded to Ethan's repulsiveness and to believe his lies about Dave. These goals are met by making Angela remarkably dense, and even then we don't believe her.</p><p>Watching "Slackers," I was appalled by the poverty of its imagination. There is even a scene where Ethan approaches a girl from behind, thinking she is Angela, and of course she turns around and it is not Angela, but a girl who wears braces and smiles at him so widely and for so long we can almost hear the assistant director instructing her to be sure the camera can see those braces.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46so5qbm5q%2FtHmRaWdr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shay-mitchell-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shay Mitchell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
