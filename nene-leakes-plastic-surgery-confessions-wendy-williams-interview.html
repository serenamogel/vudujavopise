During a game of rapid fire questions, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>talk show host</a>, 55, asked The Real Housewives of Atlanta star, 51, if there’s any more plastic surgeries she’d still want to undergo. “Oh yes! Lots of things,” NeNe, who’s already underwent multiple nose jobs and liposuction, along with a breast augmentation, gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I’d do my boobs again,” the reality star admitted, explaining, “I’d keep my implants and just move my tissue around.” NeNe went on to confess that she would “tweak” her nose again. Why? — “They say as you get older your nose gets longer. I would be no good if I woke up with my nose like that.” She also added, “I love a good filler!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As for what procedures she wouldn’t do? NeNe revealed, “no facelift, that’s too much,” noting that she’s scared to get a facelift because of the recovery photos she’s seen. “Maybe a booty?”, she questioned before ultimately deciding that she wouldn’t do it because of her body frame. “Oh no, I got hips, and I feel like I’ll look like a wide truck,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nene-leakes-reveals-the-plastic-surgery-embed.jpg alt="NeNe Leakes before & after plastic surgery " width=620 height=620 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>NeNe Leakes (L) in May 2011 and (R) in August 2018.

If you need a nip and tuck, please go and get it. I promise you,” NeNe vowed. “I don’t care what they goes to say, if you can afford it go and get it. If your husband tells you you like fine, he’s lying.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>NeNe first underwent a nose job in 2010, and later confirmed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</a> in 2016 that she got another one, this time a rhinoplasty. However, she said there “was a real medical reason” for having the procedure done.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“My cartilage was growing in my nose, and my tip was touching the top of my lip,” she explained to <strong>Andy Cohen</strong>. “But I didn’t get a full rhinoplasty the first time. No, when I did the first time, I only had my nostrils taken in on the side the very first time, and then this time, I had more cartilage moved around in my nose.” NeNe’s previously <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confessed</a> to getting smaller breast implants and a breast lift, as well as liposuction around her waist for contouring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH16e5BwZqednpp6rbHApJysZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxYycpqeelajAqrvNrGSwnZ6Zxm7DyKWjopmdqHqqutOeqa%2Bhlax8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joey-fatone-sister-janine-and-brother-steven.html><span>←</span><span>Joey Fatone | Sister Janine And Brother Steven</span></a>
